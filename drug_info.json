Choline is also a major part of another membrane phospholipid, sphingomyelin, also important for the maintenance of cell structure and function.

NO is produced by all tissues of the body and plays very important roles in the cardiovascular system, immune system and nervous system. NO is formed from L-arginine via the enzyme nitric oxide synthase or synthetase (NOS), and the effects of NO are mainly mediated by 3,'5' -cyclic guanylate or cyclic GMP. NO activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic GMP from guanosine triphosphate or GTP. Cyclic GMP is converted to guanylic acid via the enzyme cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase. NOS is a heme-containing enzyme with some sequences similar to cytochrome P-450 reductase. Several isoforms of NOS exist, two of which are constitutive and one of which is inducible by immunological stimuli. The constitutive NOS found in the vascular endothelium is designated eNOS and that present in the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system is designated nNOS. The form of NOS induced by immunological or inflammatory stimuli is known as iNOS. iNOS may be expressed constitutively in select tissues such as lung epithelium. All the nitric oxide synthases use NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) and oxygen (O2) as cosubstrates, as well as the cofactors FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide), FMN (flavin mononucleotide), tetrahydrobiopterin and heme. Interestingly, ascorbic acid appears to enhance NOS activity by increasing intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin. eNOS and nNOS synthesize NO in response to an increased concentration of calcium ions or in some cases in response to calcium-independent stimuli, such as shear stress. In vitro studies of NOS indicate that the Km of the enzyme for L-arginine is in the micromolar range. The concentration of L-arginine in endothelial cells, as well as in other cells, and in plasma is in the millimolar range. What this means is that, under physiological conditions, NOS is saturated with its L-arginine substrate. In other words, L-arginine would not be expected to be rate-limiting for the enzyme, and it would not appear that supraphysiological levels of L-arginine which could occur with oral supplementation of the amino acid^would make any difference with regard to NO production. The reaction would appear to have reached its maximum level. However, in vivo studies have demonstrated that, under certain conditions, e.g. hypercholesterolemia, supplemental L-arginine could enhance endothelial-dependent vasodilation and NO production.",

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Supplemental L-glutamine's possible immunomodulatory role may be accounted for in a number of ways. L-glutamine appears to play a major role in protecting the integrity of the gastrointestinal tract and, in particular, the large intestine. During catabolic states, the integrity of the intestinal mucosa may be compromised with consequent increased intestinal permeability and translocation of Gram-negative bacteria from the large intestine into the body. The demand for L-glutamine by the intestine, as well as by cells such as lymphocytes, appears to be much greater than that supplied by skeletal muscle, the major storage tissue for L-glutamine. L-glutamine is the preferred respiratory fuel for enterocytes, colonocytes and lymphocytes. Therefore, supplying supplemental L-glutamine under these conditions may do a number of things. For one, it may reverse the catabolic state by sparing skeletal muscle L-glutamine. It also may inhibit translocation of Gram-negative bacteria from the large intestine. L-glutamine helps maintain secretory IgA, which functions primarily by preventing the attachment of bacteria to mucosal cells. L-glutamine appears to be required to support the proliferation of mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes, as well as the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). It is also required for the maintenance of lymphokine-activated killer cells (LAK). L-glutamine can enhance phagocytosis by neutrophils and monocytes. It can lead to an increased synthesis of glutathione in the intestine, which may also play a role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosa by ameliorating oxidative stress. The exact mechanism of the possible immunomodulatory action of supplemental L-glutamine, however, remains unclear. It is conceivable that the major effect of L-glutamine occurs at the level of the intestine. Perhaps enteral L-glutamine acts directly on intestine-associated lymphoid tissue and stimulates overall immune function by that mechanism, without passing beyond the splanchnic bed.\r\n\r\nThe exact mechanism of L-glutamine's effect on NAD redox potential is unknown but is thought to involve increased amounts of reduced glutathione made available by glutamine supplementation [FDA Label]. This improvement in redox potential reduces the amount of oxidative damage which sickle red blood cells are more susceptible to. The reduction in cellular damage is thought to reduce chronic hemolysis and vaso-occlusive events.",

It is produced in the body after series of conversion steps of 7-dehydrocholesterol from exposure to UV light. 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to [DB00169] (vitamin D3) in the skin, which is then converted to [DB00146] in the liver and kidneys. [DB00146] undergoes hydroxylation to form calcitriol via 1\u03b1-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) activity [A26353]. Calcitriol is considered to be the most potent metabolite of vitamin D in humans [A3366]. Renal production of calcitriol is stimulated in response to PTH, low calcium and low phosphate [A26353]. Calcitriol plays a role in plasma calcium regulation in concert with parathyroid hormone (PTH) by enhancing absorption of dietary calcium and phosphate from the gastrointestinal tract, promoting renal tubular reabsorption of calcium in the kidneys, and stimulating the release of calcium stores from the skeletal system. In addition to promoting fatty acid synthesis and inhibiting lipolysis, calcitriol has been demonstrated to increase energy efficiency by suppressing UCP2 expression, which is modulated by signaling pathways of classical nuclear receptors (nVDR), where calcitriol acts as a natural ligand [A175615]. There is also evidence that calcitriol modulates the action of cytokines and may regulate immune and inflammatory response, cell turnover, cell differentiation [A26353]. \r\n\r\nAdministered orally and intravenously, calcitriol is commonly used as a medication in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism and resultant metabolic bone disease, hypocalcemia in patients undergoing chronic renal dialysis, and osteoporosis.

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: The mechanism of action of calcitriol in the treatment of psoriasis is accounted for by their antiproliferative activity for keratinocytes and their stimulation of epidermal cell differentiation. The anticarcinogenic activity of the active form of Calcitriol appears to be correlated with cellular vitamin D receptor (VDR) levels. Vitamin D receptors belong to the superfamily of steroid-hormone zinc-finger receptors. VDRs selectively bind 1,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>-D3 and retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) to form a heterodimeric complex that interacts with specific DNA sequences known as vitamin D-responsive elements. VDRs are ligand-activated transcription factors. The receptors activate or repress the transcription of target genes upon binding their respective ligands. It is thought that the anticarcinogenic effect of Calcitriol is mediated via VDRs in cancer cells. The immunomodulatory activity of calcitriol is thought to be mediated by vitamin D receptors (VDRs) which are expressed constitutively in monocytes but induced upon activation of T and B lymphocytes. 1,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>-D3 has also been found to enhance the activity of some vitamin D-receptor positive immune cells and to enhance the sensitivity of certain target cells to various cytokines secreted by immune cells.\r\n\r\nA study suggests that calcitriol plays an immunoregulatry role by suppressing the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) expression in human Th9, a pro-inflammatory CD4 T cell subset [A175747]. This suppression subsequently leads to repressed expression of BATF, a transcription factor essential for Th9 [A175747]. Calcitriol has also been found to induce monocyte differentiation and to inhibit lymphocyte proliferation and production of cytokines, including interleukin IL-1 and IL-2, as well as to suppress immunoglobulin secretion by B lymphocytes.

            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Calcitriol is a biologically active calcitrophic hormone with anti-osteoporotic, immunomodulatory, anticarcinogenic, antipsoriatic, antioxidant, and mood-modulatory activities. Its main sites of action are the intestine, bone, kidney and parathyroid hormone [FDA Label]. Calcitriol is a ligand for the vitamin D nuclear receptor, which is expressed in, but not limited to, gastrointestinal (GI) tissues, bones, and kidneys [A3366]. As an active form of vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, calcitriol elevates the plasma levels of calcium by stimulating intestinal calcium uptake, increasing reabsorption of calcium by the kidneys, and possibly increasing the release of calcium from skeletal stores. The duration of pharmacologic activity of a single dose of exogenous calcitriol is expected to be about 3 to 5 days [FDA Label]. \r\n\r\nIn addition to its important role in calcium metabolism, other pharmacological effects of calcitriol have been studied in various conditions including cancer models. Various studies demonstrated expression of vitamin D receptors in cancer cell lines, including mouse myeloid leukemia cells [A3366]. Calcitriol has been found to induce differentiation and/or inhibit cell proliferation _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ in many cell types, such as malignant cell lines carcinomas of the breast, prostate, colon, skin, and brain, myeloid leukemia cells, and others [A3367]. In early human prostate cancer trials, administration of 1.5 \u00b5g/d calcitriol in male participants resulted in a reduction in the rate of PSA rise in most participants, however it was coincided with dose-limiting hypercalcemia in most participants [A3366]. Hypercalcemia and hypercalcuria were evident in numerous initial trials, and this may be due to these trials not testing the drug at concentrations that are active in preclinical systems [A3367]. Findings from preclinical data show an additive or synergistic antineoplastic action of calcitriol when combined with agents including dexamethasone, retinoids, and radiation, as well as several cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs such as platinum compounds [A3367]. \r\n\r\nVitamin D deficiency has long been suspected to increase the susceptibility to tuberculosis. The active form of calcitriol, 1,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>-D3, has been found to enhance the ability of mononuclear phagocytes to suppress the intracellular growth of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. 1,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>-D3 has demonstrated beneficial effects in animal models of such autoimmune diseases as rheumatoid arthritis.

Biochemically, glucosamine is involved in glycoprotein metabolism. Glycoproteins, known as proteoglycans, form the ground substance in the extra-cellular matrix of connective tissue. Proteoglycans are polyanionic substances of high-molecular weight and contain many different types of heteropolysaccharide side-chains covalently linked to a polypeptide-chain backbone. These polysaccharides make up to 95% of the proteoglycan structure. In fact, chemically, proteoglycans resemble polysaccharides more than they do proteins. The polysaccharide groups in proteoglycans are called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs include hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, keratan sulfate, heparin and heparan sulfate. All of the GAGs contain derivatives of glucosamine or galactosamine. Glucosamine derivatives are found in hyaluronic acid, keratan sulfate and heparan sulfate. Chondroitin sulfate contains derivatives of galactosamine. The glucosamine-containing glycosaminoglycan hyaluronic acid is vital for the function of articular cartilage. GAG chains are fundamental components of aggrecan found in articular cartilage. Aggrecan confers upon articular cartilage shock-absorbing properties. It does this by providing cartilage with a swelling pressure that is restrained by the tensile forces of collagen fibers. This balance confers upon articular cartilage the deformable resilience vital to its function. In the early stages of degenerative joint disease, aggrecan biosynthesis is increased. However, in later stages, aggrecan synthesis is decreased, leading eventually to the loss of cartilage resiliency and to most of the symptoms that accompany osteoarthritis. During the progression of osteoarthritis, exogenous glucosamine may have a beneficial role. It is known that, in vitro, chondrocytes do synthesize more aggregan when the culture medium is supplemented with glucosamine. N-acetylglucosamine is found to be less effective in these in vitro studies. Glucosamine has also been found to have antioxidant activity and to be beneficial in animal models of experimental arthritis. The counter anion of the glucosamine salt (i.e. chloride or sulfate) is unlikely to play any role in the action or pharmacokinetics of glucosamine. Further, the sulfate in glucosamine sulfate supplements should not be confused with the glucosamine sulfate found in such GAGs as keratan sulfate and heparan sulfate. In the case of the supplement, sulfate is the anion of the salt. In the case of the above GAGs, sulfate is present as an ester.

Phosphatidylserine restores acetylcholine release in aging humans by maintaining an adequate supply of the molecule and is able to increase the availability of endogenous choline for de novo acetylcholine synthesis. The hippocampus of the brain is believed to be important for cognitive processes and is affected in those with Alzheimer's disease. The dendritic spines of pyramidal cells, the post-synaptic target of the excitatory input to the hippocampus, have been proposed as a substrate for information storage. Age-dependent dendritic spine loss in pyramidal neurons has been reported in the human brain, and the extent of synaptic loss appears to correlate with the degree of cognitive impairment. Phosphatidylserine treatment prevents the age-related reduction in dendritic spine density in rat hippocampus. Protein kinase C facilitation of acetylcholine release has been reported in rats.

The putative antispastic activity of supplemental glycine could be mediated by glycine's binding to strychnine-sensitive binding sites in the spinal cord.

The ability of glycine to potentiate NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission raised the possibility of its use in the management of neuroleptic-resistant negative symptoms in schizophrenia. Animal studies indicate that supplemental glycine protects against endotoxin-induced lethality, hypoxia-reperfusion injury after liver transplantation, and D-galactosamine-mediated liver injury. Neutrophils are thought to participate in these pathologic processes via invasion of tissue and releasing such reactive oxygen species as superoxide.

Because this arrangement of carbon atoms cannot be made by humans, these amino acids are an essential element in the diet. The catabolism of all three compounds initiates in muscle and yields NADH and FADH2 which can be utilized for ATP generation. The catabolism of all three of these amino acids uses the same enzymes in the first two steps. The first step in each case is a transamination using a single BCAA aminotransferase, with a-ketoglutarate as amine acceptor. As a result, three different a-keto acids are produced and are oxidized using a common branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase, yielding the three different CoA derivatives. Subsequently the metabolic pathways diverge, producing many intermediates. The principal product from valine is propionylCoA, the glucogenic precursor of succinyl-CoA. Isoleucine catabolism terminates with production of acetylCoA and propionylCoA; thus isoleucine is both glucogenic and ketogenic. Leucine gives rise to acetylCoA and acetoacetylCoA, and is thus classified as strictly ketogenic. There are a number of genetic diseases associated with faulty catabolism of the BCAAs. The most common defect is in the branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase. Since there is only one dehydrogenase enzyme for all three amino acids, all three a-keto acids accumulate and are excreted in the urine. The disease is known as Maple syrup urine disease because of the characteristic odor of the urine in afflicted individuals. Mental retardation in these cases is extensive.

Cysteine is typically synthesized in the human body when there is sufficient methionine available. Cysteine exhibits antioxidant properties and participates in redox reactions. Cysteine's antioxidant properties are typically expressed in the tripeptide glutathione, which occurs in humans as well as other organisms. Glutathione (GSH) typically requires biosynthesis from its constituent amino acids, cysteine, glycine, and glutamic acid, due to its limited systemic availability. Glutamic acid and glycine are readily available in the diets of most industrialized countries, but the availability of cysteine can be the limiting substrate. In human metabolism, cysteine is also involved in the generation of sulfide present in iron-sulfur clusters and nitrogenase by acting as a precursor. In a 1994 report released by five top cigarette companies, cysteine is one of the 599 additives to cigarettes. Its use or purpose, however, is unknown, like most cigarette additives. Its inclusion in cigarettes could offer two benefits: Acting as an expectorant, since smoking increases mucus production in the lungs; and increasing the beneficial antioxidant glutathione (which is diminished in smokers).",

These modifications reduce the affinity of ergocalciferol for the vitamin D binding protein resulting in faster clearance, limits its activation, and alters its catabolism.[A177637]\r\n\r\nThe first approved product containing ergocalciferol under the FDA records was developed by US Pharm Holdings and was FDA approved in 1941.[L6058]",

Many of L-arginine's activities, including its possible anti-atherogenic actions, may be accounted for by its role as the precursor to nitric oxide or NO. NO is produced by all tissues of the body and plays very important roles in the cardiovascular system, immune system and nervous system. NO is formed from L-arginine via the enzyme nitric oxide synthase or synthetase (NOS), and the effects of NO are mainly mediated by 3',5' -cyclic guanylate or cyclic GMP. NO activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic GMP from guanosine triphosphate or GTP. Cyclic GMP is converted to guanylic acid via the enzyme cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase. NOS is a heme-containing enzyme with some sequences similar to cytochrome P-450 reductase. Several isoforms of NOS exist, two of which are constitutive and one of which is inducible by immunological stimuli. The constitutive NOS found in the vascular endothelium is designated eNOS and that present in the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system is designated nNOS. The form of NOS induced by immunological or inflammatory stimuli is known as iNOS. iNOS may be expressed constitutively in select tissues such as lung epithelium. All the nitric oxide synthases use NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) as cosubstrates, as well as the cofactors FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide), FMN (flavin mononucleotide), tetrahydrobiopterin and heme. Interestingly, ascorbic acid appears to enhance NOS activity by increasing intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin. eNOS and nNOS synthesize NO in response to an increased concentration of calcium ions or in some cases in response to calcium-independent stimuli, such as shear stress. _In vitro_ studies of NOS indicate that the Km of the enzyme for L-arginine is in the micromolar range. The concentration of L-arginine in endothelial cells, as well as in other cells, and in plasma is in the millimolar range. What this means is that, under physiological conditions, NOS is saturated with its L-arginine substrate. In other words, L-arginine would not be expected to be rate-limiting for the enzyme, and it would not appear that supraphysiological levels of L-arginine which could occur with oral supplementation of the amino acid would make any difference with regard to NO production. The reaction would appear to have reached its maximum level.

Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. For example, folic acid is present in green vegetables, beans, avocado, and some fruits.[L5744]\r\n\r\nIn order to function within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF).

When used in high doses such as for cancer therapy, or in low doses such as for Rheumatoid Arthritis or psoriasis, [DB00563] impedes the body's ability to create folic acid.

The catabolism of all three compounds initiates in muscle and yields NADH and FADH2 which can be utilized for ATP generation. The catabolism of all three of these amino acids uses the same enzymes in the first two steps. The first step in each case is a transamination using a single BCAA aminotransferase, with a-ketoglutarate as amine acceptor. As a result, three different a-keto acids are produced and are oxidized using a common branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase, yielding the three different CoA derivatives. Subsequently the metabolic pathways diverge, producing many intermediates. The principal product from valine is propionylCoA, the glucogenic precursor of succinyl-CoA. Isoleucine catabolism terminates with production of acetylCoA and propionylCoA; thus isoleucine is both glucogenic and ketogenic. Leucine gives rise to acetylCoA and acetoacetylCoA, and is thus classified as strictly ketogenic. There are a number of genetic diseases associated with faulty catabolism of the BCAAs. The most common defect is in the branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase. Since there is only one dehydrogenase enzyme for all three amino acids, all three a-keto acids accumulate and are excreted in the urine. The disease is known as Maple syrup urine disease because of the characteristic odor of the urine in afflicted individuals. Mental retardation in these cases is extensive.

As its classification as a vitamin implies, Vitamin B6 (and pyridoxine) are essential nutrients required for normal functioning of many biological systems within the body. While many plants and microorganisms are able to synthesize pyridoxine through endogenous biological processes, animals must obtain it through their diet. \r\n\r\nMore specifically, pyridoxine is converted to pyridoxal 5-phosphate in the body, which is an important coenzyme for synthesis of amino acids, neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine), sphingolipids, and aminolevulinic acid.

Because this arrangement of carbon atoms cannot be made by humans, these amino acids are an essential element in the diet. The catabolism of all three compounds initiates in muscle and yields NADH and FADH2 which can be utilized for ATP generation. The catabolism of all three of these amino acids uses the same enzymes in the first two steps. The first step in each case is a transamination using a single BCAA aminotransferase, with a-ketoglutarate as amine acceptor. As a result, three different a-keto acids are produced and are oxidized using a common branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase, yielding the three different CoA derivatives. Subsequently the metabolic pathways diverge, producing many intermediates. The principal product from valine is propionylCoA, the glucogenic precursor of succinyl-CoA. Isoleucine catabolism terminates with production of acetylCoA and propionylCoA; thus isoleucine is both glucogenic and ketogenic. Leucine gives rise to acetylCoA and acetoacetylCoA, and is thus classified as strictly ketogenic. There are a number of genetic diseases associated with faulty catabolism of the BCAAs. The most common defect is in the branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase. Since there is only one dehydrogenase enzyme for all three amino acids, all three a-keto acids accumulate and are excreted in the urine. The disease is known as Maple syrup urine disease because of the characteristic odor of the urine in afflicted individuals. Mental retardation in these cases is extensive. Unfortunately, since these are essential amino acids, they cannot be heavily restricted in the diet; ultimately, the life of afflicted individuals is short and development is abnormal The main neurological problems are due to poor formation of myelin in the CNS.",

            "summary": "Vitamin D, in general, is a secosteroid generated in the skin when 7-dehydrocholesterol located there interacts with ultraviolet irradiation - like that commonly found in sunlight [L5689]. Both the endogenous form of vitamin D (that results from 7-dehydrocholesterol transformation), vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), and the plant-derived form, vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), are considered the main forms of vitamin d and are found in various types of food for daily intake [L5689]. Structurally, ergocalciferol differs from cholecalciferol in that it possesses a double bond between C22 and C23 and has an additional methyl group at C24 [L5689]. Finally, ergocalciferol is pharmacologically less potent than cholecalciferol, which makes vitamin D3 the preferred agent for medical use [L5689].\r\n\r\nAppropriate levels of vitamin D must be upheld in the body in order to maintain calcium and phosphorus levels in a healthy physiologic range to sustain a variety of metabolic functions, transcription regulation, and bone metabolism [A223, L5689, L1782, L5771, F4027, F4042, F4048]. However, studies are also ongoing to determine whether or not cholecalciferol may also play certain roles in cancer, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular disease, and other medical conditions that may be associated with vitamin D deficiency [L5689].",
            "indication": "Indication: Cholecalciferol use is indicated for the treatment of specific medical conditions like refractory rickets (or vitamin D resistant rickets), hypoparathyroidism, and familial hypophosphatemia [F4027, F4042].\r\n\r\nConcurrently, as one of the most commonly utilized forms of vitamin D, cholecalciferol is also very frequently used as a supplement in individuals to maintain sufficient vitamin d levels in the body or to treat vitamin D deficiency, as well as various medical conditions that can be associated directly or indirectly with vitamin d insufficiency like osteoporosis and chronic kidney disease, among others [A176041, A176044, F4051].",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Most individuals naturally generate adequate amounts of vitamin D through ordinary dietary intake of vitamin D (in some foods like eggs, fish, and cheese) and natural photochemical conversion of the vitamin D3 precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin via exposure to sunlight [L5689, F4027, F4042, F4048].\r\n\r\nConversely, vitamin D deficiency can often occur from a combination of insufficient exposure to sunlight, inadequate dietary intake of vitamin D, genetic defects with endogenous vitamin D receptor, or even severe liver or kidney disease [A243]. Such deficiency is known for resulting in conditions like rickets or osteomalacia, all of which reflect inadequate mineralization of bone, enhanced compensatory skeletal demineralization, resultant decreased calcium ion blood concentrations, and increases in the production and secretion of parathyroid hormone [A223]. Increases in parathyroid hormone stimulate the mobilization of skeletal calcium and the renal excretion of phosphorus [A223]. This enhanced mobilization of skeletal calcium leads towards porotic bone conditions [A223].\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, while vitamin D3 is made naturally via photochemical processes in the skin, both itself and vitamin D2 can be found in various food and pharmaceutical sources as dietary supplements. The principal biological function of vitamin D is the maintenance of normal levels of serum calcium and phosphorus in the bloodstream by enhancing the efficacy of the small intestine to absorb these minerals from the diet [A223]. At the liver, vitamin D3 or D2 is hydroxylated to 25-hydroxyvitamin D and then finally to the primary active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the kidney via further hydroxylation [A223, A243]. This final metabolite binds to endogenous vitamin d receptors, which results in a variety of regulatory roles - including maintaining  calcium balance, the regulation of parathyroid hormone, the promotion of the renal reabsorption of calcium, increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, and increased calcium and phosphorus mobilization of calcium and phosphorus from bone to plasma to maintain balanced levels of each in bone and the plasma [A223, A243].\r\n\r\nIn particular, calcitriol interacts with vitamin D receptors in the small intestine to enhance the efficiency of intestinal calcium and phosphorous absorption from about 10-15% to 30-40% and 60% increased to 80%, respectively [L5689]. Furthermore, calcitriol binds with vitamin D receptors in osteoblasts to stimulate a receptor activator of nuclear factor kB ligand (or RANKL) which subsequently interacts with receptor activator of nuclear factor kB (NFkB) on immature preosteoclasts, causing them to become mature bone-resorbing osteoclasts [L5689]. Such mature osteoclasts ultimately function in removing calcium and phosphorus from bone to maintain blood calcium and phosphorus levels [L5689]. Moreover, calcitriol also stimulates calcium reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate in the kidneys [L5689].\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it is believed that when calcitriol binds with nuclear vitamin D receptors, that this bound complex itself binds to retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) to generate a heterodimeric complex that consequently binds to specific nucleotide sequences in the DNA called vitamin D response elements [L5689]. When bound, various transcription factors attach to this complex, resulting in either up or down-regulation of the associated gene's activity. It is thought that there may be as much as 200 to 2000 genes that possess vitamin D response elements or that are influenced indirectly to control a multitude of genes across the genome [L5689].  It is in this way that cholecalciferol is believed to function in regulating gene transcription associated with cancer risk, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular disease linked to vitamin D deficiency [L5689]. In fact, there has been some research to suggest calcitriol may also be able to prevent malignancies by inducing cellular maturation and inducing apoptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis, exhibit anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting foam cell formation and promoting angiogenesis in endothelial colony-forming cells in vitro, inhibit immune reactions by enhancing the transcription of endogenous antibiotics like cathelicidin and regulate the activity and differentiation of CD4+ T cells, amongst a variety of other proposed actions [L5689].   ",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: The in vivo synthesis of the predominant two biologically active metabolites of vitamin D occurs in two steps. The first hydroxylation of vitamin D3 cholecalciferol (or D2) occurs in the liver to yield 25-hydroxyvitamin D while the second hydroxylation happens in the kidneys to give 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D [F4027, F4042, F4048]. These vitamin D metabolites subsequently facilitate the active absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the small intestine, serving to increase serum calcium and phosphate levels sufficiently to allow bone mineralization [F4027, F4042, F4048]. Conversely, these vitamin D metabolites also assist in mobilizing calcium and phosphate from bone and likely increase the reabsorption of calcium and perhaps also of phosphate via the renal tubules [F4027, F4042, F4048]. There exists a period of 10 to 24 hours between the administration of cholecalciferol and the initiation of its action in the body due to the necessity of synthesis of the active vitamin D metabolites in the liver and kidneys [F4027, F4042, F4048]. It is parathyroid hormone that is responsible for the regulation of such metabolism at the level of the kidneys [F4027, F4042, F4048].",

Also called menadione, this yellowish, synthetic crystalline substance is converted into the active form of the K2 vitamin inside of the animal body. While a vitamin K deficiency can be dangerous, especially to infants that may easily suffer from extensive hemorrhaging, an overdose can be as equally detrimental. Newborns that are administered too great a dosage of vitamin K3 can suffer from kernicterus, a form of severe brain damage that may produce decreased movement, loss of appetite, seizures, deafness, mental retardation, and even death. This condition is associated with an abnormally high concentration of bilirubin, a bile pigment, in the tissues of the brain, which can be caused by the presence of K3.

[T116] As plasma levels of angiotensin II fall, less activation of the G-protein coupled receptors angiotensin receptor I (AT<sub>1</sub>R) and angiotensin receptor II (AT<sub>2</sub>R) occurs. \r\n\r\nAT<sub>1</sub>R mediates vasoconstriction, inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress through a variety of signaling pathways. [T116] These include G<sub>q</sub> coupling to the inositol triphosphate pathway, activation of phospholipases C, A<sub>2</sub>, and D which contribute to eicosanoid production, activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and MAP kinases, G<sub>i</sub> and G<sub>12/13</sub>, and eventual activation of the Jak/STAT pathway leading to cell growth and production of extracellular matrix components. AT<sub>1</sub>R activation also leads to increased activity of membrane-bound NADH/NADPH oxidase which contributes to production of reactive oxygen species. Decreased activation of this receptor mediates the renoprotective, antihypertensive, and cardioprotective effects of ramipril by reducing inflammation and vasoconstriction.\r\n\r\nAT<sub>2</sub>R acts in opposition to the effects of AT<sub>1</sub>R by activating phosphotyrosine phosphatases which inhibit MAP kinases, inhibiting Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel opening, and stimulating cGMP and nitric oxide production leading to vasodilation. [T116] These counteracting effects are shared by the Mas receptor which is activated by Ang(1-7), a subtype of angiotensin produced by plasma esterases from AngI or by ACE2 from AngII produced through a secondary pathway by tonin and cathepsin G. Ang(1-7) also activates AT<sub>2</sub>R although the bulk of its effect is mediated by MasR.\r\n\r\nACE is also responsible for the breakdown of bradykinin. [T116] The resulting buildup of bradykinin due to ACE inhibition is thought to mediate the characteristic dry-cough as a side effect of ACE inhibitor medications.\r\n\r\n",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Ramipril is an ACE inhibitor similar to benazepril, fosinopril and quinapril. [T116] It is an inactive prodrug that is converted to ramiprilat in the liver, the main site of activation, and kidneys. Ramiprilat confers blood pressure lowing effects by antagonizing the effect of the RAAS. The RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from the granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. In the blood stream, renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to ATI, which is subsequently cleaved to ATII by ACE. ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. First, it stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone travels to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting tubule of nephrons where it increases sodium and water reabsorption by increasing the number of sodium channels and sodium-potassium ATPases on cell membranes. Second, ATII stimulates the secretion of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. Third, ATII increases blood pressure through direct arterial vasoconstriction. Stimulation of the Type 1 ATII receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells leads to a cascade of events resulting in myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. In addition to these major effects, ATII induces the thirst response via stimulation of hypothalamic neurons. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. ACE (also known as kininase II) is also involved in the enzymatic deactivation of bradykinin, a vasodilator. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may sustain the effects of ramiprilat by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.",

Baclofen is an agonist at the beta subunit of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors expressed on pre- and post-synaptic neurons.[A173923] Upon binding to GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, baclofen causes an influx of potassium into the neuron, leading to hyperpolarization of the neuronal membrane and decreased calcium influx at presynaptic nerve terminals. This results in a decreased rate of action potential threshold being reached by presynaptic neurons and reduced action potential of postsynaptic motor neurons that innervate the muscle spindles.

            "summary": "Amphetamine, a compound discovered over 100 years ago, is one of the more restricted controlled drugs. It was previously used for a large variety of conditions and this changed until this point where its use is highly restricted. Amphetamine, with the chemical formula alpha-methylphenethylamine, was discovered in 1910 and first synthesized by 1927. After being proven to reduce drug-induced anesthesia and produce arousal and insomnia, amphetamine racemic mix was registered by Smith, Kline and French in 1935. Amphetamine structure presents one chiral center and it exists in the form of dextro- and levo-isomers.[A18540] The first product of Smith, Kline and French was approved by the FDA on 1976.[L5194]\r\n\r\nDuring World War II, amphetamine was used to promote wakefulness in the soldiers. This use derived into a large overproduction of amphetamine and all the surplus after the war finalized ended up in the black market, producing the initiation of the illicit abuse.[A18540]",
            "indication": "Indication: Amphetamine is indicated for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) as well as for the treatment of central nervous system disorders such as narcolepsy.[A18540] \r\n\r\nADHD is a complex disorder associated with the substantial heterogeneity in etiology, clinical presentation, and treatment outcome. ADHD comes from a complex interplay between interdependent genetic and non-genetic factors which cause complex mental disorders in children and teenagers.[A174271]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder typically resenting during adolescence and characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness.[A174274]\r\n\r\nAmphetamine is also being used nowadays off-label for the treatment of obesity, depression and chronic pain.[A174268, A174283]",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: It is important to consider that amphetamine has a very similar structure to the catecholamine neurotransmitters mainly on the presence of a long planar conformation, the presence of an aromatic ring and nitrogen in the aryl side chain. Amphetamine, as well as other catecholamines, is taken into presynaptic nerve terminals by the association with two sodium ions and one chloride ion. The complex of the amphetamine with the ions is actively transported by monoamine reuptake transporters. As amphetamine acts competitively with the endogenous monoamines, the greater the number of amphetamines the more internalized amphetamine will be found.[A18540]\r\n\r\nOnce inside the presynaptic terminal, amphetamine displaces other monoamines to be stored by VMAT2 which produces the pumping of the neurotransmitters into the synapse by a process called retro-transport.[A174211] This process of release of neurotransmitters is approximately fourfold more potent in the d-isomer for the release of dopamine.[A174214]\r\n\r\nThe mechanism of action of amphetamine is complemented by the inhibition of the reuptake and of monoamine oxidase which acts synergistically to produce a significant increase the monoamine concentration.[A18540] This activity is not done as an inhibitor per se but more as a competitive substrate and thus, amphetamine is known to be a weak dopamine reuptake inhibitor, moderate noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor and very weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor. From this specific action, the l-isomer is known to be significantly less potent.[A174214]\r\n\r\nLastly, amphetamine is known to be an inhibitor of the mitochondrial-bound enzyme MAO which is the catalytic enzyme in charge of degrading all the excess of neurotransmitters. This mechanism of action is often overpassed as amphetamine is a weak MAO inhibitor but this mechanism cannot be dismissed.[A18540]",

However, the indirect effect on serotonin might have an effect on the depression and anxiety profile of ADHD.[A174241]\r\n\r\nStudies regarding the illicit use of amphetamine in which heavy consumers were studied proved the generation of a paranoid state which flagged this drug as a psychiatric danger compound.[L5197] This observation was supported by the continuous reports of misuse in patients under depression.[A18540]",

This initial product, formed by the combination of phentermine with [fenfluramine] and [dexfenfluramine] was discontinued after finding several reports of abnormal valves in nearly 30% of the consumers.[A174376, T403] Later on, phentermine was approved alone and in combination with topiramate in 2012 as a new alternative that required lower doses of phentermine to obtain the desired effect.[A174373]",

This condition commonly causes an increase in fat storage. It is an epidemic condition in the United States where over two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese and one in three Americans is obese. In the world, the incidence of obesity has nearly doubled.[A174391]",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Phentermine is an indirect-acting sympathomimetic agent that acts by releasing noradrenaline from the presynaptic vesicles in the lateral hypothalamus. This increase in noradrenaline concentration in the synaptic cleft results in the stimulation of beta2-adrenergic receptors.[A174367] Phentermine is classified as an indirect sympathomimetic due to the increase in the level of norepinephrine, dopamine and its indirect effect towards serotonin.[L5233] Some reports have indicated that phentermine inhibits the neuropeptide Y which is a principal signaling pathway for the induction of hunger.[T403] This combined effect produces a continuous flight-or-fight response in the body which reduces the hunger signal as this state is on the immediate need for energy.[T403]\r\n\r\nLastly, some reports have indicated that phentermine is a weak inhibitor of monoamine oxidase but this mechanism does not tend to produce a clinically significant response.[T49]",

            "summary": "Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic and SNRI (serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake-inhibitor) that is structurally related to [codeine] and [morphine]. Due to its good tolerability profile and multimodal mechanism of action, tramadol is generally considered a lower-risk opioid option for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. It is considered a Step 2 option on the World Health Organization's pain ladder and has about 1/10th of the potency of [morphine]. \r\n\r\nTramadol differs from other traditional opioid medications in that it doesn't just act as a \u03bc-opioid agonist, but also affects monoamines by modulating the effects of neurotransmitters involved in the modulation of pain such as serotonin and norepinpehrine which activate descending pain inhibitory pathways.[A182279] Tramadol's effects on serotonin and norepinephrine mimic the effects of other SNRI antidepressants such as [duloxetine] and [venlafaxine].\r\n\r\nTramadol exists as a racemic mixture consisting of two pharmacologically active enantiomers that both contribute to its analgesic property through different mechanisms and are also themselves metabolized into active metabolites: (+)-tramadol and its primary metabolite (+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the \u03bc opioid receptor while (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake. These pathways are complementary and synergistic, improving tramadol's ability to modulate the perception of and response to pain.[A4269,A183842] \r\n\r\nTramadol has also been shown to affect a number of other pain modulators within the central nervous system as well as non-neuronal inflammatory markers and immune mediators.[A183728,A183734,A183761,A17159,A182300] Due to the broad spectrum of targets involved in pain and inflammation, it's not surprising that the evidence has shown that tramadol is effective for a number of pain types including neuropathic pain, post-operative pain, lower back pain, as well as pain associated with labour, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and cancer. Due to its SNRI activity, tramadol also has anxiolytic, antidepressant, and anti-shivering effects which are all frequently found as comorbidities with pain.[A182300]\r\n\r\nSimilar to other opioid medications, tramadol poses a risk for development of tolerance, dependence and abuse. If used in higher doses, or with other opioids, there is a dose-related risk of overdose, respiratory depression, and death.[A183830,F4679] However, unlike other opioid medications, tramadol use also carries a risk of seizure and serotonin syndrome, particularly if used with other serotonergic medications.[A183836,A179926]",
            "indication": "Indication: Tramadol is approved for the management of moderate to severe pain in adults.[L9257,F4679]\r\n\r\nTramadol is also used off-label in the treatment of premature ejaculation.[A173986]",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Tramadol is a centrally acting \u03bc-opioid receptor agonist and SNRI (serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake-inhibitor) that is structurally related to [codeine] and [morphine]. Tramadol binds weakly to \u03ba- and \u03b4-opioid receptors and to the \u03bc-opioid receptor with 6000-fold less affinity than morphine.[A182300]\r\n\r\nTramadol exists as a racemic mixture consisting of two pharmacologically active enantiomers that both contribute to its analgesic property through different mechanisms: (+)-tramadol and its primary metabolite (+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the \u03bc opioid receptor while (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake. These pathways are complementary and synergistic, improving tramadol's ability to modulate the perception of and response to pain.[A4269] \r\n\r\nIn animal models, M1 is up to 6 times more potent than tramadol in producing analgesia and 200 times more potent in \u03bc-opioid binding.[L9257] \r\n\r\nTramadol has also been shown to affect a number of pain modulators including alpha2-adrenoreceptors, neurokinin 1 receptors, the voltage-gated sodium channel type II alpha subunit[A183728], transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1 - also known as the capsaicin receptor)[A183734], muscarinic receptors (M1 and M3), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (also known as the NMDA receptor or glutamate receptor)[A17158], Adenosine A1 receptors[A183761], and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.[A17159] \r\n\r\nIn addition to the above neuronal targets, tramadol has a number of effects on inflammatory and immune mediators involved in the pain response. This includes inhibitory effects on cytokines, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), nuclear factor-\u03baB, and glial cells as well as a change in the polarization state of M1 macrophages.[A182300]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Tramadol modulates the descending pain pathways within the central nervous system through the binding of parent and M1 metabolite to \u03bc-opioid receptors and the weak inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.[A173983,A173980] \r\n\r\nApart from analgesia, tramadol may produce a constellation of symptoms (including dizziness, somnolence, nausea, constipation, sweating and pruritus) similar to that of other opioids. \r\n\r\n**Central Nervous System**\r\n\r\nIn contrast to [morphine], tramadol has not been shown to cause histamine release. At therapeutic doses, tramadol has no effect on heart rate, left-ventricular function or cardiac index. Orthostatic hypotension has been observed.[L9257]\r\n\r\nTramadol produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centres. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem centres to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. \r\n\r\nTramadol depresses the cough reflex by a direct effect on the cough centre in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia.\r\n\r\nTramadol causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but\r\nare not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce\r\nsimilar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of\r\noxycodone overdose.[F4679]\r\n\r\nSeizures have been reported in patients receiving tramadol within the recommended dosage range. Spontaneous post-marketing reports indicate that seizure risk is increased with doses of tramadol above the recommended range. Risk of convulsions may also increase in patients with epilepsy, those with a history of seizures\r\nor in patients with a recognized risk for seizure (such as head trauma, metabolic disorders,\r\nalcohol and drug withdrawal, CNS infections), or with concomitant use of other drugs known to reduce the seizure threshold.[F4679]\r\n\r\nTramadol can cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs (e.g., anti-depressants, migraine medications). Treatment with the serotoninergic drug should be discontinued if such events (characterized by clusters of symptoms such as hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, mental status changes including confusion, irritability, extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma) occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. Tramadol should not be used in combination with MAO inhibitors or serotonin-precursors (such as L-tryptophan, oxitriptan) and should be used with caution in combination with other serotonergic drugs (triptans, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, St. John\u2019s Wort) due to the risk of serotonin syndrome.[F4679]\r\n\r\n**Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle**\r\n\r\nTramadol causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.[F4679]\r\n\r\n**Endocrine System**\r\n\r\nOpioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal or -gonadal axes. Some changes that can be seen include an increase in serum prolactin and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical signs and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changes.[F4679]\r\n\r\nHyponatremia has been reported very rarely with the use of tramadol, usually in patients with predisposing risk factors, such as elderly patients and/or patients using concomitant medications that may cause hyponatremia (e.g., antidepressants, benzodiazepines, diuretics). In some reports, hyponatremia appeared to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and resolved with discontinuation of tramadol and appropriate treatment (e.g., fluid restriction). During tramadol treatment, monitoring for signs and symptoms of hyponatremia is recommended for patients with predisposing risk factors.[F4679]\r\n\r\n**Cardiovascular**\r\n\r\nTramadol administration may result in severe hypotension in patients whose ability to maintain adequate blood pressure is compromised by reduced blood volume, or concurrent administration of drugs such as phenothiazines and other tranquillizers, sedative/hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants or general anesthetics. These patients should be monitored for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of tramadol.[F4679]\r\n\r\n**QTc-Interval Prolongation**\r\n\r\nThe maximum placebo-adjusted mean change from baseline in the QTcF interval was 5.5 ms in the 400 mg/day treatment arm and 6.5 ms in the 600 mg/day mg treatment arm, both occurring at the 8h time point. Both treatment groups were within the 10 ms threshold for QT prolongation. Post-marketing experience with the use of tramadol containing products included rare reports of QT prolongation reported with an overdose. Particular care should be exercised when administering tramadol to patients who are suspected to be at an increased risk of experiencing torsade de pointes during treatment with a QTc-prolonging drug.[F4679]\r\n\r\n**Abuse and Misuse**\r\n\r\nLike all opioids, tramadol has the potential for abuse and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Therefore, tramadol should be prescribed and handled with caution.[F4679]\r\n\r\n**Dependence/Tolerance**\r\n\r\nPhysical dependence and tolerance reflect the neuroadaptation of the opioid receptors to chronic exposure to an opioid and are separate and distinct from abuse and addiction. Tolerance, as well as physical dependence, may develop upon repeated administration of opioids, and are not by themselves evidence of an addictive disorder or abuse. Patients on prolonged therapy should be tapered gradually from the drug if it is no longer required for pain control. Withdrawal symptoms may occur following abrupt discontinuation of therapy or upon administration of an opioid antagonist. Some of the symptoms that may be associated with abrupt withdrawal of an opioid analgesic include body aches, diarrhea, gooseflesh, loss of appetite, nausea, nervousness or restlessness, anxiety, runny nose, sneezing, tremors or shivering, stomach cramps, tachycardia, trouble with sleeping, unusual increase in sweating, palpitations, unexplained fever, weakness and yawning.[F4679]",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: Tramadol undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver by N- and O- demethylation and conjugation. From the extensive metabolism, there have been identified at least 23 metabolites. There are two main metabolic pathways: the O-demethylation of tramadol to produce O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) catalyzed by CYP2D6 and the N-demethylation to N-desmethyl-tramadol (M2) catalyzed by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6.[A4269,L9257,F4679]\r\n\r\nThe wide variability in the pharmacokinetic properties between patients can partly be ascribed to polymorphisms within the gene for CYP2D6 that determine its enzymatic activity. CYP2D6\\*1 is considered the wild-type allele associated with normal enzyme activity and the \"extensive metabolizer\" phenotype; 90-95% of Caucasians are considered \"extensive metabolizers\" (with normal CYP2D6 function) while the remaining 5-10% are considered \"poor metabolizers\" with reduced or non-functioning enzyme.[A182294] CYP2D6 alleles associated with non-functioning enzyme include *3, *4, *5, and *6 while alleles associated with reduced activity include *9, *10, *17, and *41.[A183812]\r\n\r\nPoor metabolizers have reduced activity of the CYP2D6 enzyme and therefore less production of tramadol metabolites M1 and M2, which ultimately results in a reduced analgesic effect as tramadol interacts with the \u03bc-opioid receptor primarily via M1.[A4269] \r\n\r\nThere are also large differences in the frequency of these alleles between different ethnicities: \\*3, \\*4, \\*5, \\*6, and \\*41 are more common among Caucasians while \\*17 is more common in Africans for example.[A183812] Compared to 5-10% of Caucasians, only ~1% of Asians are considered poor metabolizers, however Asian populations carry a much higher frequency (51%) of the CYP2D6\\*10 allele, which is relatively rare in Caucasian populations and results in higher exposure to tramadol.[A182294]\r\n\r\nSome individuals are considered \"ultra-rapid metabolizers\", such as those carrying CYP2D6 gene duplications (CYP2D6*DUP) or multiplications. These individuals are at risk of intoxication or exaggerated effects of tramadol due to higher concentrations of its active metabolite (M1).[A182297] The occurrence of this phenotype is seen in approximately 1% to 2% of East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), 1% to 10% of Caucasians, 3% to 4% of African-Americans, and may be >10% in certain racial/ethnic groups (ie, Oceanian, Northern African, Middle Eastern, Ashkenazi Jews, Puerto Rican). The FDA label recommends avoiding the use of tramadol in these individuals.[L9257,F4679]"

The free nitrogen atom located on the azole ring of fluconazole binds with a single iron atom located in the heme group of lanosterol 14-\u03b1-demethylase.[A178774] This prevents oxygen activation and, as a result, inhibits the demethylation of lanosterol, halting the process of ergosterol biosynthesis.[A178777]  Methylated sterols are then found to accumulate in the fungal cellular membrane, leading to an arrest of fungal growth.[A178774] These accumulated sterols negatively affect the structure and function of the fungal cell plasma membrane.[A16632]\r\n\r\nFluconazole resistance may arise from an alteration in the amount or function of the target enzyme (lanosterol 14-\u03b1-demethylase), altered access to this enzyme, or a combination of the above.[A16632] Other mechanisms may also be implicated, and studies are ongoing.[A178783]",

Oseltamivir exerts its antiviral activity by inhibiting the activity of the viral neuraminidase enzyme found on the surface of the virus, which prevents budding from the host cell, viral replication, and infectivity.\r\n\r\nThe clinical benefit of use of oseltamivir is greatest when administered within 48 hours of the onset of influenza symptoms since effectiveness decreases significantly after that point in time; there is generally no benefit in use beyond 48 hours for healthy, low-risk individuals as influenza is a self-limiting illness.[A180574, L7267, A180580] However, antiviral treatment might be beneficial when initiated after 48 hours for patients with severe, complicated or progressive illness or for hospitalized patients.[A180583] According to the CDC, data from clinical trials and observational studies have demonstrated that early antiviral treatment can shorten the duration of fever and illness symptoms, and may reduce the risk of some complications (including pneumonia and respiratory failure). They recommend the use of oseltamivir in people with a higher risk of developing complications including children younger than 2 years, people over 65 years, people with some chronic conditions or immunosuppression, pregnant women, residents of long term care facilities, and indigenous communities for example.[L7264]\r\n\r\nThe benefits of oseltamivir use are controversial; a 2014 Cochrane Review of the evidence found that oseltamivir treatment had limited benefit. The authors concluded that oseltamivir use in healthy adults had small, non-specific effects on symptoms (where the time to first alleviation of symptoms was only reduced from 7 to 6.3 days), it had no effect on hospitalizations, and that there was no evidence for any reductions in complications of influenza such as pneumonia.[A179962, A179965, A179968] Due to the risk of adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, psychiatric effects and renal adverse events in adults and vomiting in children, the harms are generally considered to outweigh the small clinical benefit of use of oseltamivir. \r\n\r\nNotably, in 2017, the World Health Organization downgraded oseltamivir from its essential medicines list from a \"core\" drug to a \"complementary\" drug, due to limited cost-effectiveness.[A179086] Yearly vaccination with the influenza vaccine is still considered the best preventative measure.",

Erythromycin treats listeriosis caused by Listeria monocytogenes may also be treated with erythromycin.[L7261]\r\nErythromycin is indicated to treat pertussis (whooping cough) caused by Bordetella pertussis. It is effective in eliminating the causative organism from the nasopharynx of infected individuals, rendering them noninfectious. Clinical studies suggest that erythromycin may aid in the prevention of pertussis infection for individuals who have been exposed to the bacteria.[L7261] Respiratory tract infections due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae may also be treated with erythromycin.[L7261]  Despite the fact that no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted to this date, in vitro and certain preliminary clinical study results indicate that erythromycin may be an effective treatment in  Legionnaires\u2019 Disease.[L7261] Finally, erythromycin is indicated to treat diphtheria and other infections due to Corynebacterium diphtheriae, as an adjunct to antitoxin, to prevent carrier status and to eradicate the organism in existing carriers.[L7261] In addition to the prevention of diphtheria, erythromycin can be used to prevent rheumatic fever in penicillin intolerant patients.[L7261]\r\n \r\n\r\n**Skin infections**\r\n\r\nMild to moderate skin or skin structure infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus may be treated with erythromycin, however, resistant staphylococcal organisms may emerge.[L7261] Erythromycin can also be used to treat erythrasma, an infectious condition caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum.[L7261]\r\n\r\n\r\n**Gastrointestinal infections**\r\n\r\nIntestinal amebiasis caused by Entamoeba histolytica can be treated with oral erythromycin.

It serves as an alternative treatment for primary syphilis in patients who have demonstrated penicillin hypersensitivity. Erythromycin can also be used in the primary stage of primary syphilis.[L7261] Another approved indication of erythromycin is to treat chlamydial infections that cause conjunctivitis of the newborn, pneumonia of infancy, and urogenital infections occurring in pregnancy. It is indicated as an alternative option to tetracyclines for the treatment of uncomplicated rectal, urethral and endocervical infections in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.[L7261] Erythromycin can be used in nongonococcal urethritis can be used when tetracyclines cannot be administered.

It stops bacterial protein synthesis by inhibiting the transpeptidation/translocation step of protein synthesis and by inhibiting the assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit.[L7261,A14179] This results in the control of various bacterial infections.[A174193,L7261] The strong affinity of macrolides, including erythromycin, for bacterial ribosomes, supports their broad\u2010spectrum antibacterial activities.[A174193]\r\n\r\n",

Two of these, methylcobalamin and 5-deoxyadenosyl cobalamin, are primarily used by the body. Methionine synthase needs methylcobalamin as a cofactor. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of the amino acid homocysteine into methionine. Methionine in turn is required for DNA methylation. 5-Deoxyadenosyl cobalamin is a cofactor needed by the enzyme that converts L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. This conversion is an important step in the extraction of energy from proteins and fats.

Vitamin B12 is required for the conversion of methylmalonate to succinate. Deficiency of this enzyme could therefore interfere with the production of lipoprotein in myelin sheath tissue and so give rise to neurological lesions. The second cofactor, Methylcobalamin, is necessary for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine which is essential for the metabolism of folic acid. Deficiency of tetrahydrafolate leads to reduced synthesis of thymidylate resulting in reduced synthesis of DNA which is essential for cell maturation. Vitamin B12 is also concerned in the maintenance of sulphydryl groups in reduced form, deficiency leading to decreased amounts of reduced SH content of erythrocytes and liver cells. Overall, vitamin B12 acts as a coenzyme for various metabolic functions, including fat and carbohydrate metabolism and protein synthesis. It is necessary for growth, cell replication, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein as well as myelin synthesis. This is largely due to its effects on metabolism of methionine folic acid, and malonic acid.",

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: The mechanism of action of caffeine is complex, as it impacts several body systems, which are listed below. The effects as they relate to various body systems are described as follows:\r\n\r\n**General and cellular actions**\r\n\r\nCaffeine exerts several actions on cells, but the clinical relevance is poorly understood. One probable mechanism is the inhibition of nucleotide phosphodiesterase enzymes, adenosine receptors, regulation of calcium handling in cells, and participates in adenosine receptor antagonism.[A187721,L9857] Phosphodiesterase enzymes regulate cell function via actions on second messengers cAMP and cGMP.[A187724] This causes lipolysis through activation of hormone-sensitive lipases, releasing fatty acids and glycerol.[T722]\r\n\r\n**Respiratory**\r\n\r\nThe exact mechanism of action of caffeine in treating apnea related to prematurity is unknown, however, there are several proposed mechanisms, including respiratory center stimulation in the central nervous system, a reduced threshold to hypercapnia with increased response, and increased consumption of oxygen, among others.[L9851] The blocking of the adenosine receptors enhances respiratory drive via an increase in brain medullary response to carbon dioxide, stimulating ventilation and respiratory drive, while increasing contractility of the diaphragm.[T716]\r\n\r\n**Central nervous system**\r\n\r\nCaffeine demonstrates antagonism of all 4 adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2a, A2b, A3) in the central nervous system.[T716,L9851] Caffeine's effects on alertness and combatting drowsiness are specifically related to the antagonism of the A2a receptor.[T716]\r\n\r\n**Renal system**\r\n\r\nCaffeine has diuretic effects due to is stimulatory effects on renal blood flow, increase in glomerular filtration, and increase in sodium excretion.[T716]\r\n\r\n**Cardiovascular system**\r\n\r\nAdenosine receptor antagonism at the A1 receptor by caffeine stimulates inotropic effects in the heart. Blocking of adenosine receptors promotes catecholamine release, leading to stimulatory effects occurring in the heart and the rest of the body.  In the blood vessels, caffeine exerts direct antagonism of adenosine receptors, causing vasodilation. It stimulates the endothelial cells in the blood vessel wall to release nitric oxide, potentiating blood vessel relaxation. Catecholamine release, however, antagonizes this and exerts inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart, ultimately leading to vasoconstriction. Finally, caffeine is shown to raise systolic blood pressure measurements by 5 to 10 mmHg when it is not taken regularly, versus no effect in those who consume it regularly.[T716] The vasoconstricting effects of caffeine are beneficial in migraines and other types of headache, which are normally caused by vasodilation in the brain.[A187709,L9872]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system (CNS), heightening alertness, and sometimes causing restlessness and agitation. It relaxes smooth muscle, stimulates the contraction of cardiac muscle, and enhances athletic performance.[A298,T716,L9857] Caffeine promotes gastric acid secretion and increases gastrointestinal motility. It is often combined in products with analgesics and ergot alkaloids, relieving the symptoms of migraine and other types of headaches. Finally, caffeine acts as a mild diuretic.[T716]",

Nevertheless, it is because of this mechanism that sildenafil is also indicated for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension but is also additionally notorious for interacting with various anti-anginal or anti-hypertensive agents to develop potentially rapid, excessive, and/or fatal hypotensive crises [A175579, A175582, A175654].\r\n\r\nRegardless, sildenafil, among a variety of other similar or related PDE5 inhibitors, has become a common and effective treatment for erectile dysfunction and since its formal approval for medical use in the public in 1998 [A175732], continues to see millions of prescriptions written for it internationally. Although the medication has historically been most popularly recognized as Pfizer's brand name Viagra, sildenafil is currently available generically and even as a non-prescription over the counter medication in some countries [L5656].",
            "indication": "Indication: Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor that is predominantly employed for two primary indications:\r\n\r\n(1) the treatment of erectile dysfunction [A175582, L5611, F3853, F3856, F3886]; and\r\n\r\n(2) treatment of pulmonary hypertension, where:\r\na) the US FDA specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group I) in adults to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening [F3850]. The delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated when sildenafil was added to background epoprostenol therapy [F3850]. Studies establishing effectiveness were short-term (12 to 16 weeks), and included predominately patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II-III symptoms and idiopathic etiology (71%) or associated with connective tissue disease (CTD) (25%) [F3850];\r\n\r\nb) the Canadian product monograph specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of primary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PPH) or pulmonary hypertension secondary to connective tissue disease (CTD) in adult patients with WHO functional class II or III who have not responded to conventional therapy [F3859]. In addition, improvement in exercise ability and delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated in adult patients who were already stabilized on background epoprostenol therapy [F3859]; and\r\n\r\nc) the EMA product information specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as WHO functional class II and III, to improve exercise capacity [F3883]. Efficacy has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue disease [F3883]. The EMA label also indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension [F3883]. Efficacy in terms of improvement of exercise capacity or pulmonary hemodynamics has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart disease [F3883].",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Sildenafil is an oral therapy for erectile dysfunction [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. In the natural setting, i.e. with sexual stimulation, it restores impaired erectile function by increasing blood flow to the penis [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].\r\n\r\nThe physiological mechanism responsible for the erection of the penis involves the release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Nitric oxide then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].\r\n\r\nSildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum, where PDE5 is responsible for degradation of cGMP [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Sildenafil has a peripheral site of action on erections [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum but potently enhances the relaxant effect of NO on this tissue [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. When the NO/cGMP pathway is activated, as occurs with sexual stimulation, inhibition of PDE5 by sildenafil results in increased corpus cavernosum levels of cGMP [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Therefore sexual stimulation is required in order for sildenafil to produce its intended beneficial pharmacological effects [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].\r\n\r\nMoreover, apart from the presence of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum of the penis, PDE5 is also present in the pulmonary vasculature [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. Sildenafil, therefore, increases cGMP within pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells resulting in relaxation [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, this can lead to vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular bed and, to a lesser degree, vasodilatation in the systemic circulation [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614].",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: In vitro studies have shown that sildenafil is selective for phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Its effect is more potent on PDE5 than on other known phosphodiesterases [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. In particular, there is a 10-times selectivity over PDE6 which is involved in the phototransduction pathway in the retina [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. There is an 80-times selectivity over PDE1, and over 700-times over PDE 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. And finally, sildenafil has greater than 4,000-times selectivity for PDE5 over PDE3, the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase isoform involved in the control of cardiac contractility [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].\r\n\r\nIn eight double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies of patients with either organic or psychogenic erectile dysfunction, sexual stimulation resulted in improved erections, as assessed by an objective measurement of hardness and duration of erections (via the use of RigiScan\u00ae), after sildenafil administration compared with placebo [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Most studies assessed the efficacy of sildenafil approximately 60 minutes post-dose [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The erectile response, as assessed by RigiScan\u00ae, generally increased with increasing sildenafil dose and plasma concentration [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The time course of effect was examined in one study, showing an effect for up to 4 hours but the response was diminished compared to 2 hours [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].\r\n\r\nSildenafil causes mild and transient decreases in systemic blood pressure which, in the majority of cases, do not translate into clinical effects [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg, three times a day to patients with systemic hypertension the mean change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was a decrease of 9.4 mmHg and 9.1 mmHg respectively [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg, three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension lesser effects in blood pressure reduction were observed (a reduction in both systolic and diastolic pressure of 2 mmHg)[F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614] . At the recommended dose of 20 mg three times a day no reductions in systolic or diastolic pressure were seen [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].\r\n\r\nSingle oral doses of sildenafil up to 100 mg in healthy volunteers produced no clinically relevant effects on ECG [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension no clinically relevant effects on the ECG were reported either [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].\r\n\r\nIn a study of the hemodynamic effects of a single oral 100 mg dose of sildenafil in 14 patients with severe coronary artery disease (CAD) (> 70 % stenosis of at least one coronary artery), the mean resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by 7 % and 6 % respectively compared to baseline [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Mean pulmonary systolic blood pressure decreased by 9% [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Sildenafil showed no effect on cardiac output and did not impair blood flow through the stenosed coronary arteries [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].\r\n\r\nMild and transient differences in color discrimination (blue/green) were detected in some subjects using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test at 1 hour following a 100 mg dose, with no effects evident after 2 hours post-dose [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The postulated mechanism for this change in color discrimination is related to inhibition of PDE6, which is involved in the phototransduction cascade of the retina [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Sildenafil has no effect on visual acuity or contrast sensitivity. In a small size placebo-controlled study of patients with documented early age-related macular degeneration (n = 9), sildenafil (single dose, 100 mg) demonstrated no significant changes in visual tests conducted (which included visual acuity, Amsler grid, color discrimination simulated traffic light, and the Humphrey perimeter and photostress test) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: The metabolism of sildenafil is facilitated primarily by the CYP3A4 hepatic microsomal isoenzymes and to a minor extent, via the CYP2C9 hepatic isoenzymes [A175654, F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The predominant circulating metabolite results from the N-demethylation of sildenafil [A175654, F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. This particular resultant metabolite possesses a phosphodiesterase selectivity that is similar to the parent sildenafil molecule and a corresponding in vitro potency for PDE5 that is approximately 50% that of the parent drug [A175654, F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Moreover, plasma concentrations of the metabolite are about 40% of those recorded for sildenafil, a percentage that accounts for about 20% of sildenafil\u2019s pharmacologic effects [A175654, F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. This primary N-desmethyl metabolite of sildenafil also undergoes further metabolism, with a terminal half-life of about 4 hours [A175654, F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].\r\n\r\nIn patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, plasma concentrations of the primary N-desmethyl metabolite are about 72% those of the original parent sildenafil molecule after a regimen of 20 mg three times a day - which is consequently responsible for about a 36% contribution to sildenafil\u2019s overall pharmacological effects [A175654, F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]."

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Adapalene is used for the treatment/maintenance of mild-to-severe acne (acne vulgaris). Acne is a multifactorial condition, and evidence exists to support multiple mechanisms of action for adapalene. Adapalene binds to retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-beta and RAR-gamma; this complex subsequently binds to one of three retinoid X receptors (RXRs), which as a complex is capable of binding DNA to modulate transcriptional activity.[A193509] Although the full extent of transcriptional modulation is not described, retinoid activation is generally known to affect cellular proliferation and differentiation[A193527], and adapalene has been shown to inhibit HeLa cell proliferation and human keratinocyte differentiation.[A193515] These effects primarily account for adapalene's comedolytic and anticomedogenic properties.\r\n\r\nIn addition, adapalene modulates the immune response by down-regulating toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2) expression and inhibiting the transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1). TLR-2 recognizes _Cutibacterium acnes_ (formerly _Propionibacterium acnes_), the bacterium primarily associated with acne. TLR-2 activation causes nuclear translocation of AP-1 and downstream pro-inflammatory gene regulation. Therefore, adapalene has a general anti-inflammatory effect, which reduces inflammation-mediated acne symptoms.[A193512]\r\n\r\nWhen used with benzoyl peroxide, which possesses free radical-mediated bactericidal effects, the combination acts synergistically to reduced comedones and inflammatory lesions.[A193512]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Adapalene is anticomedogenic, preventing the formation of new comedones and inflammatory lesions, and also acts to reduce inflammation by modulating the innate immune response.[A193512] Like other retinoid compounds, adapalene is chemically stable but photosensitive; use with sunscreen is recommended. Minor skin irritations, including erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning, have been reported.[L12873]",

It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [amoxicillin], [clarithromycin], and [metronidazole], for example.[A177271][F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [omeprazole], [esomeprazole], [lansoprazole], [dexlansoprazole], and [rabeprazole].\r\n\r\nPantoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus.

This active form then makes disulfide bonds with important cysteines on the gastric acid pump, inhibiting its function.[A174247] Specifically, pantoprazole binds to the _sulfhydryl group_ of H+, K+-ATPase, which is an enzyme implicated in accelerating the final step in the acid secretion pathway.

            "summary": "Lovastatin, also known as the brand name product Mevacor, is a lipid-lowering drug and fungal metabolite derived synthetically from a fermentation product of _Aspergillus terreus_.[A174550] Originally named Mevinolin, lovastatin belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage abnormal lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver.[A174553] More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as \"bad cholesterol\"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]\r\n\r\nLovastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [simvastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]\r\n\r\nWhile all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, while lovastatin has been found to have an average decrease in LDL-C of 25-40%.[A174580,A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Potency is thought to correlate to tissue permeability as the more lipophilic statins such as lovastatin are thought to enter endothelial cells by passive diffusion, as opposed to hydrophilic statins such as [pravastatin] and [rosuvastatin] which are taken up into hepatocytes through OATP1B1 (organic anion transporter protein 1B1)-mediated transport.[A181424,A181460] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181538, A181427]",
            "indication": "Indication: Lovastatin is indicated to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and the need for coronary revascularization procedures in individuals without symptomatic cardiovascular disease, average to moderately elevated total-C and LDL-C, and below average HDL-C. It is indicated as an intervention alternative in individuals presenting dyslipidemia at risk of developing atherosclerotic vascular disease. The administration of this agent should be accompanied by the implementation of a fat and cholesterol-restricted diet.[F4661]\r\n\r\nTherapy with lipid-altering agents should be a component of multiple risk factor intervention in those individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Lovastatin is indicated as an adjunct to diet for the reduction of elevated total-C and LDL-C levels in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (Types IIa and IIb2), when the response to diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and to other nonpharmacological measures alone has been inadequate.[F4661,F4664]\r\n\r\nLovastatin is also indicated to slow the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with coronary heart disease as part of a treatment strategy to lower total-C and LDL-C to target levels.[F4661]\r\n\r\nLovastatin is indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce total-C, LDL-C and apolipoprotein B levels in adolescent boys and girls with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) who are at least one year post-menarche, 10 to 17 years of age, with HeFH if after an adequate trial of diet therapy the following findings are present: LDL-C remains greater than 189 mg/dL or LDL-C remains greater than 160 mg/dL and there is a positive family history of premature cardiovascular disease or two or more other CVD risk factors are present in the adolescent patient.\r\n\r\nBefore administering lovastatin, it is important to rule out the presence of secondary causes of hypercholesterolemia and a lipid profile should be performed.\r\n\r\nPrescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Lovastatin is a lactone which is readily hydrolyzed _in vivo_ to the corresponding \u03b2-hydroxyacid and strong inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, a hepatic microsomal enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A ) to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421,A174553] At therapeutic lovastatin doses, HMG-CoA reductase is not completely blocked, thereby allowing biologically necessary amounts of mevalonate to be available. Because the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate is an early step in the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol, therapy with lovastatin would not be expected to cause an accumulation of potentially toxic sterols.[F4664]\r\n\r\nLovastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increase hepatic uptake of LDL. Lovastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL and a significant reduction in the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475]\r\n\r\nA significant effect on LDL-C reduction was seen within 2 weeks of initiation of lovastatin, and the maximum therapeutic response occurred within 4-6 weeks. The response was maintained during continuation of therapy. Single daily doses given in the evening were more effective than the same dose given in the morning, perhaps because cholesterol is synthesized mainly at night. When therapy with lovastatin is stopped, total cholesterol has been shown to return to pre-treatment levels.[F4664]\r\n\r\nIn vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that lovastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.\r\n\r\nStatins have also been found to bind allosterically to \u03b22 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.[A181559]\r\n\r\nLovastatin has been reported to have beneficial effects on certain cancers. This includes a multi-factorial stress-triggered cell death (apoptosis) and DNA degradation response in breast cancer cells.[A181937] It has also been shown to inhibit histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) activity and increase the accumulation of acetylated histone-H3 and the expression of p21(WAF/CIP) in human cancer cells, suggesting that statins might serve as novel HDAC inhibitors for cancer therapy and chemoprevention.[A15235]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Lovastatin is an oral antilipemic agent which reversibly inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, lovastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A174580,A181087,A181406,A181925]\r\n\r\nElevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A174580,A181397,A181403] Clinical studies have shown that lovastatin reduces LDL-C and total cholesterol by 25-40%.[A174580] The 50% inhibitory dose is known to be of 46 mcg/kg which is translated into a reduction of approximately 30% of plasma cholesterol.[A174553]\r\n\r\n**Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis**\r\n\r\nLovastatin, like other inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, occasionally causes myopathy manifested as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above ten times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Myopathy sometimes takes the form of rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria, and rare fatalities have occurred. The risk of myopathy is dose-related and is increased by high levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity in plasma. In a clinical study (EXCEL)[A181925] in which patients were carefully monitored and some interacting drugs were excluded, there was one case of myopathy among 4933 patients randomized to lovastatin 20 to 40 mg daily for 48 weeks, and 4 among 1649 patients randomized to 80 mg daily.\r\n\r\nPredisposing factors for myopathy include advanced age (\u226565 years), female gender, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Chinese patients may also be at increased risk for myopathy. In most cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when treatment was promptly discontinued.\r\n\r\nThe risk of myopathy during treatment with lovastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of interacting drugs such as [fenofibrate], [niacin], [gemfibrozil], [cyclosporine], and strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 enzyme.  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[F4661,F4664]\r\n\r\nReal-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]\r\n\r\n**Liver Dysfunction**\r\n\r\nPersistent increases (to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal) in serum transaminases occurred in 1.9% of adult patients who received lovastatin for at least one year in early clinical trials. When the drug was interrupted or discontinued in these patients, the transaminase levels usually fell slowly to pretreatment levels. The increases usually appeared 3 to 12 months after the start of therapy with lovastatin, and were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms.[F4661] In the EXCEL study,[A181925] the incidence of persistent increases in serum transaminases over 48 weeks was 0.1% for placebo, 0.1% at 20 mg/day, 0.9% at 40 mg/day, and 1.5% at 80 mg/day in patients on lovastatin. However, in post-marketing experience with lovastatin, symptomatic liver disease has been reported rarely at all dosages.[F4661]",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: Lovastatin is given as a lactone prodrug and thus, in order to produce its mechanism of action, it is required to be converted to the active beta-hydroxy form. This drug activation process does not seem to be related to CYP isoenzyme activity[A414] but rather to be controlled by the activity of serum paraoxonase.[A15320]\r\n\r\nLovastatin is metabolized by the microsomal hepatic enzyme system (Cytochrome P-450 isoform 3A4). The major active metabolites present in human plasma are the \u03b2-hydroxy acid of lovastatin, its 6'-hydroxy, 6'-hydroxymethyl, and 6'-exomethylene derivatives.[F4664] The uptake of lovastatin by the liver is enhanced by the activity of OATP1B1.[A35026] "

            "summary": "Temazepam, like many other similar and related benzodiazepines, acts as a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulator and is capable of eliciting a variety of actions including sedation, hypnosis, skeletal muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, and anxiolytic action [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721].\r\n\r\nAlthough the chemical synthesis of temazepam was established by 1965 [A175333], mainstream contemporary use of the medication did not occur until it's legitimate use as treatment for insomnia was accepted and approved later on. In particular, before temazepam saw regular prescription use in civilians it was - and still is - employed by the US military as a sedative-hypnotic medication to be taken by soldiers, pilots, etc. to obtain the necessary rest required for medical recovery or scheduled maneuvers and operations [A175339]. Regardless, temazepam has become one of the most frequently prescribed medications internationally and sees millions of prescriptions every year. Unfortunately, however, given its frequent use and the inherent nature of its pharmacological effects, temazepam - like many other benzodiazepines - possesses a high potential for misuse and is genuinely capable of developing drug tolerance, physical dependence, and addiction in users.",
            "indication": "Indication: Temazepam is specifically indicated only for the short-term management of insomnia [FDA Label], [L5539]. Furthermore, such management is generally predominantly associated with the symptomatic relief of transient and short-term insomnia characterized by difficulty in falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings and/or early morning awakenings [F3718]. In particular, the official prescribing information for temazepam typically specifies that the instructions issued for dispensed prescriptions of the medication should indicate specifically that patients are only expected to use the therapy for short periods of time - usually 7-10 days in general [FDA Label, F3718]. Subsequently, treatment with temazepam should usually not exceed 7 to 10 consecutive days and nor should it be prescribed in quantities exceeding a one-month supply [F3718].\r\n\r\nSome regional prescribing information also notes that temazepam may be used for premedication prior to minor surgery or other related procedures [L5539].",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is considered the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human body [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721]. When GABA binds to GABA(a) receptors found in neuron synapses, chloride ions are conducted across neuron cell membranes via an ion channel in the receptors [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721]. With enough chloride ions conducted, the local, associated neuron membrane potentials are hyperpolarized - making it more difficult or less likely for action potentials to fire, ultimately resulting in less excitation of the neurons [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721]. \r\n\r\nSubsequently, benzodiazepines like temazepam can bind to benzodiazepine receptors that are components of various varieties of GABA(a) receptors [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721]. This binding acts to enhance the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA(a) receptor, which ultimately enhances GABA ligand binding at the receptors [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721]. This enhanced ligand binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the receptors increases the aforementioned chloride ion conduction (perhaps reportedly via an increase in the frequency of the chloride channel opening), resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the associated neuron cells [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721]. Combined with the notion that such benzodiazepine receptor associated GABA(a) receptors exist both peripherally and in the CNS, this activity consequently facilitates various effects like sedation, hypnosis, skeletal muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, and anxiolytic action [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721].",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Temazepam is a benzodiazepine used as a hypnotic agent in the management of insomnia [FDA Label] [A175207, A175210, L5539, F3718, F3721]. Temazepam produces CNS depression at limbic, thalamic, and hypothalamic levels of the CNS [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721]. Temazepam increases the affinity of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) for GABA receptors by binding to benzodiazepine receptors [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721]. Results are sedation, hypnosis, skeletal muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, and anxiolytic action [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721].\r\n\r\nIn sleep laboratory studies, the effect of temazepam was compared to placebo during a two week period [F3718]. The studies demonstrated a linear dose-response improvement in total sleep time and sleep latency with substantial drug-placebo differences apparent for total sleep time and for sleep latency at higher doses of temazepam [F3718]. Regardless, REM sleep was ultimately unchanged but slow wave sleep was decreased [F3718].\r\n\r\nMoreover, a transient syndrome, known as \"rebound insomnia\", wherein the symptoms that led to treatment with temazepam in the first place recur in an enhanced form, may happen on withdrawal of temazepam treatment [F3718]. The possibility of this occurrence is in part why long term use of temazepam is not recommended due to worries over tolerance and dependence wherein patients' bodies become physiologically accustomed to the regular presence and pharmacological effect of higher and higher doses of the benzodiazepine used [F3718].\r\n\r\nThe duration of hypnotic effect and the profile of unwanted adverse effects may be influenced by the distribution and elimination half-lives of the administered temazepam and any active metabolites that may be formed [F3718]. When such half-lives are long, the drug or its metabolite(s) may accumulate during periods of nightly administration and be associated with impairments of cognitive and motor performance during waking hours [F3718]. Conversely, if half-lives are short, the drug and metabolites would be cleared before the next dose is ingested, and carry-over effects related to sedation or CNS depression should be minimal or not present at all [F3718]. However, during nightly use and for an extended period, pharmacodynamic tolerance or adaptation to some effects of benzodiazepine hypnotics may develop - which may also contribute to the possibility of 'rebound insomnia' [F3718].\r\n\r\nConsequently, if the drug has a very short elimination half-life, it is possible that a relative deficiency (for example, in relation to benzodiazepine GABA(a) receptor sites) may occur at some point in the interval between each night's use [F3718]. This sequence of events may account for certain clinical findings reported happening after several weeks of nightly use of rapidly eliminated benzodiazepine hypnotics, including increased wakefulness during the last third of the night and the appearance of increased daytime anxiety [F3718].",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: First-pass metabolism of temazepam is minimal at approximately 5-8% of an administered dose [F3718, L5539]. Nevertheless, temazepam is principally metabolized in the liver where most of the unchanged drug is directly conjugated to glucuronide and excreted in the urine [F3718, L5539]. In particular, the primary metabolite present in the blood is the O-conjugate of temazepam [FDA Label, F3718, L5539]. Less than 5% of the drug is demethylated to oxazepam and subsequently eliminated as the glucuronide [F3718, L5539]. Regardless, the glucuronides of temazepam have no demonstrable CNS activity and it is believed that no active metabolites are formed in general [FDA Label, F3718, L5539]. Since temazepam mainly undergoes Phase II conjugation reactions, it is proposed that it is devoid of CYP450 interactions.[A38982]"

Thiazides like methyclothiazide also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. This results in an increase in potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. The antihypertensive mechanism of methyclothiazide is less well understood although it may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle.",

Although the exact mechanism of action has not been fully determined, evidence shows that cladribine is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase to the nucleotidecladribine triphosphate (CdATP; 2-chloro-2\u2032-deoxyadenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate), which accumulates and is incorporated into DNA in cells such as lymphocytes that contain high levels of deoxycytidine kinase and low levels of deoxynucleotidase, resulting in DNA strand breakage and inhibition of DNA synthesis and repair. High levels of CdATP also appear to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, which leads to an imbalance in triphosphorylated deoxynucleotide (dNTP) pools and subsequent DNA strand breaks, inhibition of DNA synthesis and repair, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and ATP depletion, and cell death. Unlike other antimetabolite drugs, cladribine has cytotoxic effects on resting as well as proliferating lymphocytes. However, it does cause cells to accumulate at the G1/S phase junction, suggesting that cytotoxicity is associated with events critical to cell entry into S phase. It also binds purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), however no relationship between this binding and a mechanism of action has been established.",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Cladribine is a synthetic purine nucleoside that acts as an antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressive effects. Cladribine differs structurally from deoxyadenosine only by the presence of a chlorine atom at position 2 of the purine ring, which results in resistance to enzymatic degradation by adenosine deaminase. Due to this resistance, cladribine exhibits a more prolonged cytotoxic effect than deoxyadenosine against resting and proliferating lymphocytes. Cladribine is one of a group of chemotherapy drugs known as the anti-metabolites.&nbsp;Anti-metabolites stop cells from making and repairing DNA, which are processes that are necessary for cancer cells to grow and multiply.",

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: The dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor is a 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor associated with G<sub>i</sub> proteins. In lactotrophs, stimulation of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> causes inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, which decreases intracellular cAMP concentrations and blocks IP3-dependent release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores. Decreases in intracellular calcium levels may also be brought about via inhibition of calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels, rather than via inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Additionally, receptor activation blocks phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK and decreases MAPK/ERK kinase phosphorylation. Inhibition of MAPK appears to be mediated by c-Raf and B-Raf-dependent inhibition of MAPK/ERK kinase. Dopamine-stimulated growth hormone release from the pituitary gland is mediated by a decrease in intracellular calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels rather than via adenylyl cyclase inhibition. Stimulation of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway leads to improvements in coordinated muscle activity in those with movement disorders. Cabergoline is a long-acting dopamine receptor agonist with a high affinity for D2 receptors. Receptor-binding studies indicate that cabergoline has low affinity for dopamine D1, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>,- and &alpha;<sub>2</sub>- adrenergic, and 5-HT<sub>1</sub>- and 5-HT<sub>2</sub>-serotonin receptors.",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Cabergoline stimulates centrally-located dopaminergic receptors resulting in a number of pharmacologic effects. Five dopamine receptor types from two dopaminergic subfamilies have been identified. The dopaminergic D1 receptor subfamily consists of D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>5</sub> subreceptors, which are associated with dyskinesias. The dopaminergic D2 receptor subfamily consists of D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub> and D<sub>4</sub> subreceptors, which are associated with improvement of symptoms of movement disorders. Thus, agonist activity specific for D2 subfamily receptors, primarily D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> receptor subtypes, are the primary targets of dopaminergic antiparkinsonian agents. It is thought that postsynaptic D2 stimulation is primarily responsible for the antiparkinsonian effect of dopamine agonists, while presynaptic D2 stimulation confers neuroprotective effects. This semisynthetic ergot derivative exhibits potent agonist activity on dopamine D<sub>2</sub>- and D<sub>3</sub>-receptors. It also exhibits: agonist activity (in order of decreasing binding affinities) on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)<sub>2B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>, dopamine D<sub>4</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, dopamine D<sub>1</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors and antagonist activity on &alpha;<sub>2B</sub>, &alpha;<sub>2A</sub>, and &alpha;<sub>2C</sub> receptors. Parkinsonian Syndrome manifests when approximately 80% of dopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain is lost. As this striatum is involved in modulating the intensity of coordinated muscle activity (e.g. movement, balance, walking), loss of activity may result in dystonia (acute muscle contraction), Parkinsonism (including symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and flattened affect), akathesia (inner restlessness), tardive dyskinesia (involuntary muscle movements usually associated with long-term loss of dopaminergic activity), and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which manifests when complete blockage of nigrostriatal dopamine occurs. High dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain causes hallucinations and delusions; these side effects of dopamine agonists are manifestations seen in patients with schizophrenia who have overractivity in this area of the brain. The hallucinogenic side effects of dopamine agonists may also be due to 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> agonism. The tuberoinfundibular pathway of the brain originates in the hypothalamus and terminates in the pituitary gland. In this pathway, dopamine inhibits lactotrophs in anterior pituitary from secreting prolactin. Increased dopaminergic activity in the tuberoinfundibular pathway inhibits prolactin secretion. ",

In some patients in clinical studies, blood pressure changes were associated with orthostatic symptoms, bradycardia, and, in one case in a healthy volunteer, transient sinus arrest accompanied by syncope [FDA label]. The mechanism of orthostatic hypotension caused by ropinirole is assumed to be due to a D2-mediated blunting of noradrenergic response to a standing position, followed by a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance.

Isradipine binds to calcium channels with high affinity and specificity and inhibits calcium flux into cardiac and arterial smooth muscle cells.

CCBs target L-type calcium channels, the major channel in muscle cells that mediates contraction. Similar to other DHP CCBs, isradipine binds directly to inactive calcium channels stabilizing their inactive conformation. Since arterial smooth muscle depolarizations are longer in duration than cardiac muscle depolarizations, inactive channels are more prevalent in smooth muscle cells. Alternative splicing of the alpha-1 subunit of the channel gives isradipine additional arterial selectivity.

Calcium ions entering the cell through these channels bind to calmodulin. Calcium-bound calmodulin then binds to and activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Activated MLCK catalyzes the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain subunit of myosin, a key step in muscle contraction. Signal amplification is achieved by calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors.

            "summary": "Ever since its discovery and availability for sale and use in the late 1940s, lidocaine has become an exceptionally commonly used medication [T583]. In particular, lidocaine's principal mode of action in acting as a local anesthetic that numbs the sensations of tissues means the agent is indicated for facilitating local anesthesia for a large variety of surgical procedures [F4349, L5930, L5948]. It ultimately elicits its numbing activity by blocking sodium channels so that the neurons of local tissues that have the medication applied on are transiently incapable of signaling the brain regarding sensations [F4349, L5930, L5948]. In doing so, however, it can block or decrease muscle contractile, resulting in effects like vasodilation, hypotension, and irregular heart rate, among others [F4349, L5930, L5948]. As a result, lidocaine is also considered a class Ib anti-arrhythmic agent [L5930, L5948, F4468]. Nevertheless, lidocaine's local anesthetic action sees its use in many medical situations or circumstances that may benefit from its action, including the treatment of premature ejaculation [A177625].\r\n\r\nRegardless, lidocaine is currently available as a relatively non-expensive generic medication that is written for in millions of prescriptions internationally on a yearly basis. It is even included in the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines [L6055].",
            "indication": "Indication: Lidocaine is an anesthetic of the amide group indicated for production of local or regional anesthesia by infiltration techniques such as percutaneous injection and intravenous regional anesthesia by peripheral nerve block techniques such as brachial plexus and intercostal and by central neural techniques such as lumbar and caudal epidural blocks [F4349, L5930].",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Lidocaine is a local anesthetic of the amide type [F4349, L5930, L5948]. It is used to provide local anesthesia by nerve blockade at various sites in the body [F4349, L5930, L5948]. It does so by stabilizing the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action [F4349, L5930, L5948]. In particular, the lidocaine agent acts on sodium ion channels located on the internal surface of nerve cell membranes [F4349, L5930, L5948]. At these channels, neutral uncharged lidocaine molecules diffuse through neural sheaths into the axoplasm where they are subsequently ionized by joining with hydrogen ions [F4349, L5930, L5948]. The resultant lidocaine cations are then capable of reversibly binding the sodium channels from the inside, keeping them locked in an open state that prevents nerve depolarization [F4349, L5930, L5948]. As a result, with sufficient blockage, the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron will ultimately not depolarize and will thus fail to transmit an action potential [F4349, L5930, L5948]. This facilitates an anesthetic effect by not merely preventing pain signals from propagating to the brain but by aborting their generation in the first place [F4349, L5930, L5948].\r\n\r\nIn addition to blocking conduction in nerve axons in the peripheral nervous system, lidocaine has important effects on the central nervous system and cardiovascular system [F4349, L5930, L5948]. After absorption, lidocaine may cause stimulation of the CNS followed by depression and in the cardiovascular system, it acts primarily on the myocardium where it may produce decreases in electrical excitability, conduction rate, and force of contraction [F4349, L5930, L5948].",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Excessive blood levels of lidocaine can cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure [F4349, L5930]. With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to the block of autonomic fibers, a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system, and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present [F4349, L5930]. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded [F4349, L5930].\r\n\r\nIn particular, such cardiac effects are likely associated with the principal effect that lidocaine elicits when it binds and blocks sodium channels, inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of electrical action potential impulses necessary to facilitate muscle contraction [F4349, L5930, L5948]. Subsequently, in cardiac myocytes, lidocaine can potentially block or otherwise slow the rise of cardiac action potentials and their associated cardiac myocyte contractions, resulting in possible effects like hypotension, bradycardia, myocardial depression, cardiac arrhythmias, and perhaps cardiac arrest or circulatory collapse [F4349, L5930, L5948].\r\n\r\nMoreover, lidocaine possesses a dissociation constant (pKa) of 7.7 and is considered a weak base [L5948]. As a result, about 25% of lidocaine molecules will be un-ionized and available at the physiological pH of 7.4 to translocate inside nerve cells, which means lidocaine elicits an onset of action more rapidly than other local anesthetics that have higher pKa values [L5948]. This rapid onset of action is demonstrated in about one minute following intravenous injection and fifteen minutes following intramuscular injection [L5930]. The administered lidocaine subsequently spreads rapidly through the surrounding tissues and the anesthetic effect lasts approximately ten to twenty minutes when given intravenously and about sixty to ninety minutes after intramuscular injection [L5930].\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it appears that the efficacy of lidocaine may be minimized in the presence of inflammation [L5948]. This effect could be due to acidosis decreasing the amount of un-ionized lidocaine molecules, a more rapid reduction in lidocaine concentration as a result of increased blood flow, or potentially also because of increased production of inflammatory mediators like peroxynitrite that elicit direct actions on sodium channels [L5948].",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: Lidocaine is metabolized predominantly and rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys [F4349, L5930]. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation [F4349, L5930]. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide [F4349, L5930]. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine HCl [F4349, L5930]. Approximately 90% of lidocaine HCl administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged [F4349, L5930]. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2,6-dimethylaniline [F4349, L5930]."

It is also commonly injected into surgical wound sites to reduce pain for up to 20 hours after surgery. In comparison to other local anesthetics it has a long duration of action. It is also the most toxic to the heart when administered in large doses. This problem has led to the use of other long-acting local anaesthetics:ropivacaine and levobupivacaine. Levobupivacaine is a derivative, specifically an enantiomer, of bupivacaine. Systemic absorption of local anesthetics produces effects on the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. At blood concentrations achieved with therapeutic doses, changes in cardiac conduction, excitability, refractoriness, contractility, and peripheral vascular resistance are minimal. However, toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conduction and excitability, which may lead to atrioventricular block, ventricular arrhythmias and to cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in fatalities. In addition, myocardial contractility is depressed and peripheral vasodilation occurs, leading to decreased cardiac output and arterial blood pressure.

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: The exact mechanisms by which valproate exerts it's effects on epilepsy, migraine headaches, and bipolar disorder are unknown however several pathways exist which may contribute to the drug's action.\r\n\r\nValproate is known to inhibit succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase.[A177991] This inhibition results in an increase in succinic semialdehyde which acts as an inhibitor of GABA transaminase ultimately reducing GABA metabolism and increasing GABAergic neurotransmission. As GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, this increase results in increased inhibitory activity.[A457] A possible secondary contributor to cortical inhibition is a direct suppression of voltage gated sodium channel activity and indirect suppression through effects on GABA.\r\n\r\nIt has also been suggested that valproate impacts the extracellular signal-related kinase pathway (ERK).[A457] These effects appear to be dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) and result in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. This activation increases expression of several downstream targets including ELK-1 with subsequent increases in c-fos, growth cone-associated protein-43 which contributes to neural plasticity, B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia-2 which is an anti-apoptotic protein, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which is also involved in neural plasticity and growth. Increased neurogenesis and neurite growth due to valproate are attributed to the effects of this pathway. An additional downstream effect of increased BDNF expression appears to be an increase in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors which contribute further to increased GABAergic activity.[A177997]\r\n\r\nValproate exerts a non-competitive indirect inhibitory effect on myo-inosital-1-phophate synthetase.[A178000] This results in reduced de novo synthesis of inositol monophosphatase and subsequent inositol depletion. It is unknown how this contributed to valproate's effects on bipolar disorder but [lithium] is known to exert a similar inositol-depleting effect.[A178003] Valproate exposure also appears to produce down-regulation of protein kinase C proteins (PKC)-\u03b1 and -\u03b5 which are potentially related to bipolar disorder as PKC is unregulated in the frontal cortex of bipolar patients. This is further supported by a similar reduction in PKC with lithium.[A178015] The inhibition of the PKC pathway may also be a contributor to migraine prophylaxis.[A178018] Myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate, a PKC substrate, is also downregulated by valproate and may contribute to changes in synaptic remodeling through effects on the cytoskeleton.[A178021]\r\n\r\nValproate also appears to impact fatty acid metabolism.[A457] Less incorporation of fatty acid substrates in sterols and glycerolipids is thought to impact membrane fluidity and result in increased action potential threshold potentially contributing to valproate's antiepileptic action.[A178024] Valproate has been found to be a non-competitive direct inhibitor of brain microsomal long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase.[A14708] Inhibition of this enzyme decreases available arichidonyl-CoA, a substrate in the production of inflammatory prostaglandins. It is thought that this may be a mechanism behind valproate's efficacy in migraine prophylaxis as migraines are routinely treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which also inhibit prostaglandin production.\r\n\r\nFinally, valproate acts as a direct histone deactylase (HDAC) inhibitor.[A178030] Hyperacetylation of lysine residues on histones promoted DNA relaxation and allows for increased gene transcription. The scope of valproate's genomic effects is wide with 461 genes being up or down-regulated.[A178027] The relation of these genomic effects to therapeutic value is not fully characterized however H3 and H4 hyperacetylation correlates with improvement of symptoms in bipolar patients.[A178033] Histone hyperacetylation at the BDNF gene, increasing BDNF expression, post-seizure is known to occur and is thought to be a neuroprotective mechanism which valproate may strengthen or prolong.[A178036] H3 hyperacetylation is associated with a reduction in glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a pro-apoptotic enzyme, contributing further to valproate's neuroprotective effects.[A11814]",

It is also thought that valproate exerts a neuroprotective effect preventing damage and neural degeneration in epilepsy, migraines, and bipolar disorder.\r\n\r\nValproate is hepatotoxic and teratogenic. The reasons for this are unclear but have been attributed to the genomic effects of the drug.[A457]\r\n\r\nA small proof-of concept study found that valproate increases clearance of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) when combined with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) by reactivating the virus to allow clearance, however, a larger multicentre trial failed to show a significant effect on HIV reservoirs when added to HAART.[A458,A177859] The FDA labeling contains a warning regarding HIV reactivation during valproate use.[label].",

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Migraines are complex physiological events characterized by unilateral throbbing headaches combined with photophobia and other aversions to sensory input. Migraine attacks are generally divided into phases: the premonitory phase, which typically involves irritability, fatigue, yawning, and stiff neck; the headache phase, which lasts for between four and 72 hours; and the postdrome phase, which lasts for up to a day following resolution of pain and whose symptoms are similar to those of the premonitory phase. In addition, neurological deficits, collectively termed migraine aura, may precede the headache phase.[A193797, A193794]\r\n\r\nThe underlying pathophysiology of migraines is a matter of active research but involves both neurological and vascular components. The head pain associated with migraine is thought to be a consequence of activation of the nociceptive nerves comprising the trigeminocervical complex (TCC).[A193794] Terminals of nociceptive nerves that innervate the dura matter release vasoactive peptides, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), resulting in cranial vasodilation. Finally, when present, migraine aura appears to correlate with a transient wave(s) of cortical depolarization, termed cortical spreading depression (CSD).[A193794,A193851]\r\n\r\nTriptans, including zolmitriptan, are proposed to act in three ways. The main mechanism is through modulation of nociceptive nerve signalling in the central nervous system through 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptors throughout the TCC and associated areas of the brain. In addition, triptans can enhance vasoconstriction, both through direct 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>-mediated dilation of cranial blood vessels,[A462, A198741] as well as through 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>-mediated suppression of CGRP release.[A193794, L12978]\r\n\r\nAlthough triptans are classically described solely in terms of their effects on 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptors, they also act as 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> agonists as well. This 5-HT subtype is also found throughout the TCC, but is not present appreciably in cerebral vasculature; the significance of triptan-mediated 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> activation is currently not well described.[A193791] Additionally, CSD that initiates in the ipsilateral parietal region may exert its effects in a manner that relies on 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptor activation, suggesting that triptans may have some effect on CSD-mediated symptoms.[A193794, A198738]",

It is through the downstream effects of 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> activation that triptans are proposed to provide acute relief of migraines.[L12978,A462,A193791] Zolmitriptan is also a vasoconstrictor,[A193803] leading to possible adverse cardiovascular effects such as myocardial ischemia/infarction, arrhythmias, cerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, gastrointestinal ischemia, and peripheral vasospastic reactions. In addition, chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, and/or pressure has been reported, along with the possibility of medication overuse headaches and serotonin syndrome.

Prostaglandins are responsible for eliciting pain sensations.[A176366] Acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, therefore, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory effects. Though acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the active site of this enzyme, studies have shown that acetaminophen (paracetamol) blocks COX indirectly.[F4133] Studies also suggest that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant type of the COX enzyme that is unique from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2.[A468] This enzyme has been referred to as _COX-3_. The antipyretic actions of acetaminophen are likely attributed to direct action on heat-regulating centers in the brain, resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating, and loss of body heat.[F4133] The exact mechanism of action of this drug is not fully understood at this time, but future research may contribute to deeper knowledge.[F4133] ",

At normal therapeutic doses, NAPQI undergoes fast conjugation with glutathione and is subsequently metabolized to produce both cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.[Label]\r\n\r\nHigh doses of acetaminophen (overdoses) can lead to hepatic necrosis due to the depletion of glutathione and of binding of high levels of reactive metabolite (NAPQI) to important parts of liver cells.

Particularly, CYP2D6 poor metabolizer did not experience the analgesic effect of codeine.[A473,A261461] However, this is unlikely to be the main mechanism of action of codeine as only 5% of codeine is metabolized to morphine.[A473] Other hypotheses also postulate that codeine-6-glucuronide, the main metabolite of codeine, mediates the analgesic effect of codeine as it not only has an affinity to the mu receptors as codeine but also can be metabolized to morphine-6-glucuronide, which was observed to be more potent than morphine.[A474] \r\n\r\nBinding to the mu receptors by codeine activates the G-proteins G\u03b1<sub>i</sub>, causing a decrease in intracellular cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> level.[A179533,A261466] This causes hyperpolarization of nociceptive neurons, thus imparing the transmission of pain signals.[A179533,A261466]\r\n\r\n",

In addition to decreasing pain, codeine also causes sedation, drowsiness, and respiratory depression [A175096]. \r\n\r\n**Antitussive activity**\r\n\r\nThis drug has shown antitussive activity in clinical trials [A175102] and has been effective in cough secondary to tuberculosis and insomnia due to coughing [A175096]. Codeine suppresses the cough reflex through a direct effect on the cough center in the medulla [F3658].\r\n\r\n**Effects on intestinal motility**\r\n\r\nCodeine may reduce intestinal motility through both a local and possibly central mechanism of action [F3661]. This may possibly lead to constipation [F3658]. The chronic use of opioids, including codeine sulfate, may lead to obstructive bowel disease, particularly in patients with underlying disorders of intestinal motility [FDA label]. \r\n\r\n**Effects on the central nervous system**\r\n\r\nCodeine phosphate is an opioid analgesic with uses similar to those of morphine, but is much less potent as an analgesic. Its primary site of action is at the _mu_ opioid receptors distributed throughout the central nervous system. The sedative activities of codeine are less potent than those of morphine [F3658]. Codeine may cause respiratory system depression by the activation of \u03bc-opioid receptors at specific sites in the central nervous system [A175108].\r\n\r\n**Effects on blood pressure**\r\n\r\nThis drug poses an increased risk of compromised ability to maintain blood pressure due to peripheral vasodilation and other mechanisms [FDA label]. \r\n\r\n**Effects on chronic cancer pain and other types of pain**\r\n\r\nCodeine is an opioid analgesic with similar indications to those of morphine, however, is much less potent in its pain alleviating properties. Its primary action takes place at the mu opioid receptors, which are distributed throughout the central nervous system. The average duration of action is about 4 hours [F3658].\r\n\r\nRegular dosing of opioid analgesics such as codeine in patients with severe cancer pain has been well documented to improve symptoms [A175096], [A175105].",

Agonist action by DHE on 5-HT<sub>1b</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1d</sub> receptors inhibits nociceptive signalling through the ventroposteromedial thalamus to the trigeminal sensory neurons. Further action on 5-HT<sub>1b</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1d</sub> receptors with the addition of agonist activity on 5-HT<sub>1f</sub> in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis decreases afferent signalling to trigeminal sensory neurons which contributes to central sensitization. The success of experimental compounds selectively targetting the 5-HT<sub>1f</sub> receptor lends support to this mechanism. Lastly, action at 5-HT<sub>1d</sub> receptors on trigeminal nerve terminals inhibits the release of vasoactive neuropeptides thought to contribute to pain and inflammation during a migraine attack. DHE is known to have 10-fold less potency at the 5-HT<sub>1b</sub> receptor than its predecessor ergotamine which reduces the incidence of vascular side effects.[A239239] Notably, DHE slowly diffuses from receptors resulting in unreliable prediction of effects from plasma concentration.

These amines are important in regulating mood.  The monoamine hypothesis in depression, one of the oldest hypotheses, postulates that deficiencies of serotonin (5-HT) and/or norepinephrine (NE) neurotransmission in the brain lead to depressive effects [A174670].   This drug counteracts these mechanisms, and this may be the mechanism of amitriptyline in improving depressive symptoms.\r\n\r\nWhether its analgesic effects are related to its mood-altering activities or attributable to a different, less obvious pharmacological action (or a combination of both) is unknown [A174661].",

The inhibition of COMT also causes a reduction in circulating 3-OMD as a result of decreased peripheral metabolism of levodopa. This may lead to an increase distribution of levodopa into the CNS through the reduction of its competitive substrate, 3-OMD, for transport mechanisms.

Physiological substrates of COMT include dopa, catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine) and their hydroxylated metabolites. The function of COMT is the elimination of biologically active catechols and some other hydroxylated metabolites. COMT is responsible for the elimination of biologically active catechols and some other hydroxylated metabolites. In the presence of a decarboxylase inhibitor, COMT becomes the major metabolizing enzyme for levodopa catalyzing it to 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-L-phenylalanine (3-OMD) in the brain and periphery. When tolcapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone.

Indometacin was first discovered in 1963 and it was first approved for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration in 1965, [A486] along with other acetic acid derivatives such as [diclofenac] and [sulindac] that were also developed during the 1960s.[A177871] Since then, indometacin has been extensively studied in clinical trials as one of the most potent NSAIDs in blocking prostaglandin synthesis and was among the first NSAIDs to be used in the symptomatic treatment of migraine and for headaches that eventually became known as \u201cindomethacin-responsive\u201d headache disorders.[A177871] \r\n\r\nMost commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, acute shoulder pains, and acute gouty arthritis, indometacin is currently available as oral capsules as well as other methods of administration, including rectal and intravenous formulations.

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Indometacin is a nonspecific and reversible inhibitor of the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzyme or prostaglandin G/H synthase. There are two identified isoforms of COX: COX-1 is universally present in most body tissues and is involved in the synthesis of the prostaglandins and thromboxane A2, while COX-2 is expressed in response to injury or inflammation.[A177871] Constitutively expressed, the COX-1 enzyme is involved in gastric mucosal protection, platelet, and kidney function by catalyzing the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (PG) G2 and PGG2 to PGH2.[A177871] COX-2 is constitutively expressed and highly inducible by inflammatory stimuli. It is found in the central nervous system, kidneys, uterus, and other organs. COX-2 also catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGG2 and PGG2 to PGH2. In the COX-2-mediated pathway, PGH2 is further converted to PGE2 and PGI2 (also known as prostacyclin). PGE2 is involved in mediating inflammation, pain, and fever. Decreasing levels of PGE2 leads to reduced inflammatory reactions. Indometacin is known to inhibit both isoforms of COX, however, with greater selectivity for COX-1, which accounts for its increased adverse gastric effects relative to other NSAIDs. It binds to the enzyme's active site and prevents the interaction between the enzyme and its substrate, arachidonic acid. Indometacin, unlike other NSAIDs, also inhibits phospholipase A2, the enzyme responsible for releasing arachidonic acid from phospholipids. The analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects of indomethacin as well as adverse reactions associated with the drug occur as a result of decreased prostaglandin synthesis. Its antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation.\r\n\r\nThe exact mechanism of action of indometacin in inducing closure of a patent ductus arteriosus is not fully understood; however, it is thought to be through inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.[L6778] At birth, the ductus arteriosus is normally closed as the tension of the oxygen increases significantly after birth.[A177880] Patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants is associated with congenital heart malformations where PGE1 mediates an opposite effect to that of oxygen. PGE1 dilates the ductus arteriosus through smooth muscle relaxation and prevents the closure of the ductus arteriosus.[A177880] By inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, indometacin promotes the closure of ductus arteriosus.[L10553]\r\n\r\nIndometacin has been described as possessing anticancer and antiviral properties through activation of protein kinase R (PKR) and downstream phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, inhibiting protein synthesis.[A234429, A234434]",

Its therapeutic action does not involve pituitary-adrenal stimulation.[L6778] Indometacin primarily works by suppressing inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis by providing relief of pain as well as reducing fever, swelling, and tenderness. This effectiveness has been demonstrated by a reduction in the extent of joint swelling, the average number of joints displaying symptoms of inflammation, and the severity of morning stiffness. Increased mobility was demonstrated by a decrease in total walking time and by improved functional capability seen as an increase in grip strength.[L6778] In clinical trials, indometacin was shown to be effective in relieving the pain, reducing the fever, swelling, redness, and tenderness of acute gouty arthritis. Due to its pharmacological actions, the use of indometacin is associated with the risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as gastrointestinal effects such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines.[L6778]\r\n\r\nIn a study of healthy individuals, acute oral and intravenous indometacin therapy resulted in a transiently diminished basal and CO2 stimulated cerebral blood flow; this effect disappeared in one study after one week of oral treatment.[L6778] The clinical significance of this effect has not been established. Compared to other NSAIDs, it is suggested that indometacin is a more potent vasoconstrictor that is more consistent in decreasing cerebral blood flow and inhibiting CO2 reactivity.[A177871] There have been studies that show indometacin directly inhibiting neuronal activity to some extent in the trigeminocervical complex after either superior salivatory nucleus or dural stimulation.[A177871]",

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Metformin's mechanisms of action are unique from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic drugs. Metformin decreases blood glucose levels by decreasing hepatic glucose production (also called gluconeogenesis), decreasing the intestinal absorption of glucose, and increasing insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.[L12207] It is well established that metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I activity, and it has since been generally postulated that its potent antidiabetic effects occur through this mechanism.[A36534, A36557]   The above processes lead to a decrease in blood glucose, managing type II diabetes and exerting positive effects on glycemic control.\r\n\r\nAfter ingestion, the organic cation transporter-1 (OCT1) is responsible for the uptake of metformin into hepatocytes (liver cells). As this drug is positively charged, it accumulates in cells and in the mitochondria because of the membrane potentials across the plasma membrane as well as the mitochondrial inner membrane. Metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I, preventing the production of mitochondrial ATP leading to increased cytoplasmic ADP:ATP and AMP:ATP ratios.[A36534] These changes activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an enzyme that plays an important role in the regulation of glucose metabolism.[A176348] Aside from this mechanism, AMPK can be activated by a lysosomal mechanism involving other activators.  Following this process, increases in AMP:ATP ratio also inhibit _fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase_ enzyme, resulting in the inhibition of gluconeogenesis, while also inhibiting _adenylate cyclase_ and decreasing the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP),[A36534] a derivative of ATP used for cell signaling [A176351]. Activated AMPK phosphorylates two isoforms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase enzyme, thereby inhibiting fat synthesis and leading to fat oxidation, reducing hepatic lipid stores and increasing liver sensitivity to insulin.[A36534] \r\n\r\nIn the intestines, metformin increases anaerobic glucose metabolism in enterocytes (intestinal cells), leading to reduced net glucose uptake and increased delivery of lactate to the liver. Recent studies have also implicated the gut as a primary site of action of metformin and suggest that the liver may not be as important for metformin action in patients with type 2 diabetes. Some of the ways metformin may play a role on the intestines is by promoting the metabolism of glucose by increasing glucagon-like peptide I (GLP-1) as well as increasing gut utilization of glucose.[A36534] \r\n\r\nIn addition to the above pathway, the mechanism of action of metformin may be explained by other ways, and its exact mechanism of action has been under extensive study in recent years.[A36535, A36554, A36555, A36557]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: **General effects**\r\n\r\nInsulin is an important hormone that regulates blood glucose levels.[T514] Type II diabetes is characterized by a decrease in sensitivity to insulin, resulting in elevations in blood glucose when the pancreas can no longer compensate. In patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, insulin is unable to exert adequate effects on tissues and cells (i.e. insulin resistance)[T514] and insulin deficiency may also be present.[L5753]\r\n\r\nMetformin reduces hepatic production of glucose, decreases the intestinal absorption of glucose, and enhances insulin sensitivity by increasing both peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. In contrast with drugs of the sulfonylurea class, which lead to hyperinsulinemia, the secretion of insulin is unchanged with metformin use.[L12207]\r\n\r\n**Effect on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)**\r\n\r\nHbA1c is an important periodic measure of glycemic control used to monitor diabetic patients. Fasting plasma glucose is also a useful and important measure of glycemic control. In a 29-week clinical trial of subjects diagnosed with type II diabetes, metformin decreased the fasting plasma glucose levels by an average of 59 mg/dL from baseline, compared to an average increase of 6.3 mg/dL from baseline in subjects taking a placebo.[L12207]  Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was decreased by about 1.4% in subjects receiving metformin, and increased by 0.4% in subjects receiving placebo only.[L12207]",

            "summary": "Methadone is a potent synthetic analgesic that works as a full \u00b5-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. As a full MOR agonist, methadone mimics the natural effects of the body's opioids, endorphins, and enkephalins through the release of neurotransmitters involved in pain transmission. It also has a number of unique characteristics that have led to its increased use in the last two decades; in particular, methadone has a lower risk of neuropsychiatric toxicity compared to other opioids (due to a lack of active metabolites), minimal accumulation in renal failure, good bioavailability, low cost, and a long duration of action.[F4685,F4688,F4691,A185885,A185900,A185903] \r\n\r\nDue to its unique mechanism of action, methadone is particularly useful for the management of hard to treat pain syndromes such as neuropathic pain and cancer pain requiring higher and more frequent doses of shorter-acting opioids.[A185888,A185891,A185897] Compared with [morphine], the gold standard reference opioid, methadone also acts as an agonist of \u03ba- and \u03c3-opioid receptors, as an antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, and as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine uptake.[A497,A5344] Specifically by inhibiting the NMDA receptor, methadone dampens a major excitatory pain pathway within the central nervous system.[A185876] Compared to other opioids, methadone's effects on NMDA inhibition may explain it's improved analgesic efficacy and reduced opioid tolerance.[A185891,A185894]\r\n\r\nMethadone shares similar effects and risks of other opioids such as [morphine], [hydromorphone], [oxycodone], and [fentanyl]. However, it also has a unique pharmacokinetic profile. Compared with short-acting and even extended-release formulations of [morphine], methadone displays a comparatively longer duration of action and half-life. These effects make methadone a good option for the treatment of severe pain and addiction as fewer doses are needed to maintain analgesia and prevent opioid withdrawal symptoms. However, methadone also has an unpredictable half-life with interindividual variability, which leads to an unpredictable risk of respiratory depression and overdose when initiating or titrating therapy.[A183995]\r\n\r\nOverall, methadone's pharmacological actions result in analgesia, suppression of opioid withdrawal symptoms, sedation, miosis, sweating, hypotension, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting (via binding within the chemoreceptor trigger zone), and constipation. At higher doses, methadone use can result in respiratory depression, overdose, and death.[F4685,F4688,F4691]\r\n\r\nTreatment of opioid addiction with methadone, [buprenorphine], or slow-release oral [morphine] (SROM) is termed Opioid Agonist Treatment (OAT) or Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST). The intention of substitution of illicit opioids with the long-acting opioids used in OAT is to prevent withdrawal symptoms for 24-36 hours following dosing to ultimately reduce cravings and drug-seeking behaviours. Use of OAT is also intended to lead to social stabilization by reducing crime rates, incarceration, use of illicit opioids such as [heroin] or [fentanyl], and ultimately marginalization.[A185882] Illegally purchased opioids present many other harms in addition to overdose as they can be injected and may be laced with other substances that increase the risk of harm or overdose. Provision of OAT is often combined with education about harm reduction including use of clean needles and injection supplies in an effort to reduce the risks associated with injection drug use such as contraction of HIV and Hepatitis C and other complications including skin infections, abscesses, or endocarditis.",
            "indication": "Indication: Methadone is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. It's recommended that use is reserved for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (eg, nonopioid analgesics, opioid combination products) are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain.[F4688]\r\n\r\nMethadone is also indicated for detoxification treatment of opioid addiction (heroin or other morphine-like drugs), and for maintenance substitution treatment for opioid dependence in adults in conjunction with appropriate social and medical services.[F4685,F4691]",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Methadone is a synthetic opioid analgesic with full agonist activity at the \u00b5-opioid receptor. While agonism of the \u00b5-opioid receptor is the primary mechanism of action for the treatment of pain, methadone also acts as an agonist of \u03ba- and \u03c3-opioid receptors within the central and peripheral nervous systems. Interestingly, methadone differs from [morphine] (which is considered the gold standard reference opioid) in its antagonism of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and its strong inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine uptake, which likely also contributes to its antinociceptive activity.[A497] \r\n\r\nMethadone is administered as a 50:50 racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)-stereoisomers, with (R)-methadone demonstrating ~10-fold higher affinity and potency for the \u00b5-opioid receptor than the (S) stereoisomer.[A497] The analgesic activity of the racemate is almost entirely due to the (R)-isomer, while the (S)-isomer lacks significant respiratory depressant activity but does have antitussive effects.\r\n\r\nWhile methadone shares similar effects and risks of other opioids such as [morphine], [hydromorphone], [oxycodone], and [fentanyl] it has a number of unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that distinguish it from them and make it a useful agent for the treatment of opioid addiction. For example, methadone abstinence syndrome, although qualitatively similar to that of morphine, differs in that the onset is slower, the course is more prolonged, and the symptoms are less severe.",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Overall, methadone's pharmacological actions result in analgesia, suppression of opioid withdrawal symptoms, sedation, miosis (through binding to receptors in the pupillary muscles), sweating, hypotension, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting (via binding within the chemoreceptor trigger zone), and constipation. Like many basic drugs, methadone also enters mast cells and releases histamine by a non-immunological mechanism leading to flushing, pruritus, and urticaria, which can commonly be misattributed to an allergic reaction. \r\n\r\nCompared to other opioids, methadone has fewer active metabolites and therefore a lower risk of neuropsychiatric toxicity. This means that higher doses needed to manage severe pain or addiction are less likely to result in delirium, hyperalgesia, or seizures.[A185900,A185903]\r\n\r\nSimilar to morphine, both methadone isomers are 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists, although l-methadone produces greater inhibition than d-methadone. \r\n\r\nMethadone's effects are reversible by naloxone with a pA2 value similar to its antagonism of morphine.[F4685,F4688,F4691]\r\n\r\n\r\n**Dependence and Tolerance**\r\n\r\nAs with other opioids, tolerance and physical dependence may develop upon repeated administration of methadone and there is a potential for development of psychological dependence. Physical dependence and tolerance reflect the neuroadaptation of the opioid receptors to chronic exposure to an opioid and are separate and distinct from abuse and addiction. Tolerance, as well as physical dependence, may develop upon repeated administration of opioids, and are not by themselves evidence of an addictive disorder or abuse.\r\n\r\nPatients on prolonged therapy should be tapered gradually from the drug if it is no longer required for pain control. Withdrawal symptoms may occur following abrupt discontinuation of therapy or upon administration of an opioid antagonist. Some of the symptoms that may be associated with abrupt withdrawal of an opioid analgesic include body aches, diarrhea, gooseflesh, loss of appetite, nausea, nervousness or restlessness, anxiety, runny nose, sneezing, tremors or shivering, stomach cramps, tachycardia, trouble with sleeping, unusual increase in sweating, palpitations, unexplained fever, weakness and yawning.[F4685,F4688,F4691]\r\n\r\n\r\n**Cardiac Conduction Effects**\r\n\r\nLaboratory studies, both in vivo and in vitro, have demonstrated that methadone inhibits cardiac potassium channels and prolongs the QT interval. Cases of QT interval prolongation and serious arrhythmia (torsades de pointes) have been observed during treatment with methadone. These cases appear to be more commonly associated with, but not limited to, higher dose treatment (> 200 mg/day). Methadone should be administered with particular caution to patients already at risk for development of prolonged QT interval (e.g., cardiac hypertrophy, concomitant diuretic use, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia). Careful monitoring is recommended when using methadone in patients with a history of cardiac conduction disease, those taking medications affecting cardiac conduction, and in other cases where history or physical exam suggest an increased risk of dysrhythmia.[F4685,F4688,F4691]\r\n\r\n\r\n**Respiratory Depression and Overdose**\r\n\r\nSerious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of methadone. Patients should be\r\nmonitored for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of methadone or following a dose increase.\r\n\r\nRespiratory depression is of particular concern in elderly or debilitated patients as well as in those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia or hypercapnia when even moderate therapeutic doses may dangerously decrease pulmonary ventilation. Methadone should be administered with extreme caution to patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve such as: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, severe obesity, sleep apnea syndrome, myxedema, kyphoscoliosis, and CNS depression or coma. In these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of methadone may decrease respiratory drive while simultaneously increasing airway resistance to the point of apnea. Alternative, non-opioid analgesics should be considered, and methadone should be employed only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose.\r\n\r\nInfants exposed in-utero or through breast milk are at risk of life-threatening respiratory depression upon delivery or when nursed. \r\n\r\nMethadone's peak respiratory depressant effects typically occur later, and persist longer than its peak analgesic effects, in the short-term use setting. These characteristics can contribute to cases of iatrogenic overdose, particularly during treatment initiation and dose titration.[F4685,F4688,F4691]\r\n\r\n\r\n**Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure**\r\n\r\nThe respiratory depressant effects of opioids and their capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other intracranial lesions or a pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure. Furthermore, opioids produce effects which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries. In such patients, methadone must be used with caution, and only if it is deemed essential.[F4685,F4688,F4691]\r\n\r\n\r\n**Incomplete Cross-tolerance between Methadone and other Opioids**\r\n\r\nPatients tolerant to other opioids may be incompletely tolerant to methadone. Incomplete cross-tolerance is of particular concern for patients tolerant to other \u00b5-opioid agonists who are being converted to methadone, thus making the determination of dosing during opioid conversion complex. Deaths have been reported during conversion from chronic, high-dose treatment with other opioid agonists. A high degree of \u201copioid tolerance\u201d does not eliminate the possibility of methadone overdose, iatrogenic or otherwise.[F4685,F4688,F4691]\r\n\r\nCrosstolerance between morphine and methadone has been demonstrated, as steady-state plasma methadone concentrations required for effectiveness (C50%) were higher in abstinent rats previously dosed with morphine, as compared to controls.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Misuse, Abuse, and Diversion of Opioids**\r\n\r\nMethadone is a mu-agonist opioid with an abuse liability similar to morphine. Methadone, like morphine and other opioids used for analgesia, has the potential for being abused and is subject to criminal diversion.\r\n\r\nMethadone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when dispensing Methadone in situations where the clinician is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion.[F4685,F4688,F4691]\r\n\r\n\r\n**Hypotensive Effect**\r\n\r\nThe administration of methadone may result in severe hypotension in patients whose ability to maintain normal blood pressure is compromised (e.g., severe volume depletion).[F4685,F4688,F4691]\r\n\r\n\r\n**Gastrointestinal Effects**\r\n\r\nMethadone and other morphine-like opioids have been shown to decrease bowel motility and cause constipation. This primarily occurs through agonism of opioid receptors in the gut wall. Methadone may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.[F4685,F4688,F4691]\r\n\r\n\r\n**Sexual Function/Reproduction**\r\n\r\nReproductive function in human males may be decreased by methadone treatment. Reductions in ejaculate volume and seminal vesicle and prostate secretions have been reported in methadone-treated individuals. In addition, reductions in serum testosterone levels and sperm motility, and abnormalities in sperm morphology have been reported. Long-term use of opioids may be associated with decreased sex hormone levels and symptoms such as low libido, erectile dysfunction, or infertility.[F4685,F4688,F4691]",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: Methadone undergoes fairly extensive first-pass metabolism. Cytochrome P450 enzymes, primarily CYP3A4, CYP2B6, and CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent CYP2C9, CYP2C8, and CYP2D6, are responsible for conversion of methadone to EDDP (2-ethyl-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine) and other inactive metabolites, which are excreted mainly in the urine. Methadone first undergoes N-demethylation to form a highly unstable compound that spontaneously converts to EDDP through cyclization and dehydration. EDDP is then converted to 2-ethyl5-methyl-3,3-diphenyl-1-pyrroline (EDMP). Both EDDP and EDMP are inactive.[F4685,F4691,A185234]\r\n\r\nThe CYP isozymes also demonstrate different affinities for metabolizing the different methadone enantiomers: CYP2C19, CYP3A7, and CYP2C8 preferentially metabolize (R)-methadone while CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and CYP2C18 preferentially metabolize (S)-methadone. CYP3A4 does not have an enantiomer preference.[A184061,A185234]\r\n\r\nSingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the cytochrome P450 enzymes can impact methadone pharmacokinetics and contribute to the interindividual variation in response to methadone therapy. In particular, CYP2B6 polymorphisms have been shown to impact individual response to methadone as it is the predominant determinant involved in the N-demethylation of methadone, clearance, and the metabolic ratios of [methadone\\]/[EDDP].[A184610] The SNPs CYP2B6\\*6, \\*9, \\*11, CYP2C19\\*2, \\*3, CYP3A4\\*1B, and CYP3A5\\*3 result in increased methadone plasma concentrations, decreased N-demethylation, and decreased methadone clearance, while homozygous carriers of CYP2B6\\*6/\\*6 demonstrate diminished metabolism and clearance of methadone.[A184610] See the pharmacogenomics section for further information.\r\n\r\nPharmacogenomic effects on the CYP enzymes can be significant as the long half-life of methadone can result in some individuals having higher than normal therapeutic levels which puts them at risk of dose-related side effects. For example, elevated (R)-methadone levels can increase the risk of respiratory depression, while elevated (S)-methadone levels can increase the risk of severe cardiac arrhythmias due to prolonged QTc interval.[A184610]"

            "indication": "Indication: Olanzapine was initially used orally and intramuscularly for the chronic treatment of schizophrenia in patients over 13 years old and other psychiatric disorders such as bipolar I disorder including mixed or manic episodes.[A177014] \r\n\r\nOlanzapine is also indicated, in combination with lithium or valproate for the short-term treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults.[FDA label]\r\n\r\nAs well, olanzapine is indicated, in combination with fluoxetine for the treatment of episodes of depression associated with bipolar disorder type 1 and treatment-resistant depression in patients over 10 years old.[A177014]\r\n\r\nOlanzapine is also approved for the management of psychomotor agitation associated with schizophrenia and bipolar I mania.[FDA label]\r\n\r\nSchizophrenia is a complex biochemical brain disorder that affects the person's ability to differentiate reality. It is usually observed as the presence of delusions, hallucinations, social withdrawal and disturbed thinking.[L5936]\r\n\r\nBipolar disorder is a mental health condition defined by periods of extreme mood disturbances. It is categorized in different types from which type 1 is known to involve episodes of severe mania and often depression while type 2 presents less severe forms of mania.[L5939]\r\n\r\nOlanzapine is also indicated in combination with [samidorphan] for the treatment of bipolar I disorder, either as an adjunct to lithium or valproate or as monotherapy for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes or as maintenance therapy, and for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults.[L34359]",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: The activity of olanzapine is achieved by the antagonism of multiple neuronal receptors including the dopamine receptor D1, D2, D3 and D4 in the brain, the serotonin receptors 5HT2A, 5HT2C, 5HT3 and 5HT6, the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor, the histamine receptor H1 and multiple muscarinic receptors.[A176993, A176999]\r\n\r\nAs abovementioned, olanzapine presents a wide profile of targets, however, its antagonistic effect towards the dopamine D2 receptor in the mesolimbic pathway is key as it blocks dopamine from having a potential action at the post-synaptic receptor. The binding of olanzapine to the dopamine D2 receptors is easily dissociable and hence, it allows for a certain degree of dopamine neurotransmission.[A177014]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, olanzapine acts in the serotonin 5HT2A receptors in the frontal cortex in a similar manner than the reported on dopamine D2 receptors. This determined effect allows for a decrease in adverse effects.[A177014]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: The effect of olanzapine in the D2 receptor is reported to produce the positive effects of this drug such as a decrease in hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, disorganized thought, and disorganized behavior. On the other hand, its effect on the serotonin 5HT2A receptor prevents the onset of anhedonia, flat affect, alogia, avolition and poor attention.[A177014] Based on the specific mechanism of action, olanzapine presents a higher affinity for the dopamine D2 receptor when compared to the rest of the dopamine receptor isotypes. This characteristic significantly reduces the presence of side effects.[T554]\r\n\r\nClinical trials for the original use of olanzapine demonstrated significant effectiveness in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in adults and acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder in adolescents.[A177008]\r\n\r\nThe effect of olanzapine on dopamine and serotonin receptors has been suggested to reduce chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting as those receptors are suggested to be involved in this process. For this effect, several clinical trials have been conducted and it has been shown that olanzapine can produce a significant increase in total control of nausea and vomiting.[A176993] In a high-level study of the effect of olanzapine for this condition, a complete response on the delay phase was observed in 84% of the individual and control of emesis of over 80% despite the phase.[A176999]",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: Olanzapine is greatly metabolized in the liver, which represents around 40% of the administered dose, mainly by the activity of glucuronide enzymes and by the cytochrome P450 system. From the CYP system, the main metabolic enzymes are CYP1A2 and CYP2D6.[A177014] As part of the phase I metabolism, the major circulating metabolites of olanzapine, accounting for approximate 50-60% of this phase, are the 10-N-glucuronide and the 4'-N-desmethyl olanzapine which are clinically inactive and formed by the activity of CYP1A2.[T548] On the other hand, CYP2D6 catalyzes the formation of 2-OH olanzapine and the flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO3) is responsible for N-oxide olanzapine.[T551]\r\n\r\nOn the phase II metabolism of olanzapine, UGT1A4 is the key player by generating direct conjugation forms of olanzapine.[T551]"

This drug was the first clinical useful drug in its class, and its approval was followed by the formulation of many other proton pump inhibitor drugs [A174232].

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Hydrochloric acid (HCl) secretion into the gastric lumen is a process regulated mainly by the H(+)/K(+)-ATPase of the proton pump [A175180], expressed in high quantities by the parietal cells of the stomach. ATPase is an enzyme on the parietal cell membrane that facilitates hydrogen and potassium exchange through the cell, which normally results in the extrusion of potassium and formation of HCl (gastric acid) [A174295].\r\n\r\nOmeprazole is a member of a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted _benzimidazoles_, that stop gastric acid secretion by selective inhibition of the _H+/K+ ATPase_ enzyme system. Proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole bind covalently to cysteine residues via disulfide bridges on the alpha subunit of the _H+/K+ ATPase_ pump, inhibiting gastric acid secretion for up to 36 hours [A175192].  This antisecretory effect is dose-related and leads to the inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion, regardless of the stimulus [FDA label].  \r\n\r\n**Mechanism of H. pylori eradication**\r\n\r\nPeptic ulcer disease (PUD) is frequently associated with _Helicobacter pylori_ bacterial infection (NSAIDs) [A175195]. The treatment of H. pylori infection may include the addition of omeprazole or other proton pump inhibitors as part of the treatment regimen [FDA label], [A175198]. \r\n_H. pylori_ replicates most effectively at a neutral pH [A175213]. Acid inhibition in H. pylori eradication therapy, including proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole, raises gastric pH, discouraging the growth of H.pylori [A175198]. It is generally believed that proton pump inhibitors inhibit the _urease_ enzyme, which increases the pathogenesis of H. pylori in gastric-acid related conditions [A175216].   ",

After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect of omeprazole is usually achieved within one hour, with the maximum effect occurring by 2 hours after administration. The inhibitory effect of omeprazole on acid secretion increases with repeated once-daily dosing, reaching a plateau after four days [FDA label].\r\n\r\n**Effects on serum gastrin**\r\n\r\nIn studies of 200 or more patients, serum gastrin levels increased during the first 1-2 weeks of daily administration of therapeutic doses of omeprazole. This occurred in a parallel fashion with the inhibition of acid secretion. No further increase in serum gastrin occurred with continued omeprazole administration. Increased gastrin causes enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased serum Chromogranin A (CgA) levels. The increased CgA levels may lead to false positive results in diagnostic studies for neuroendocrine tumors [FDA label].\r\n\r\n**Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell effects**\r\n\r\nHuman gastric biopsy samples have been obtained from more than 3000 pediatric and adult patients treated with omeprazole in long-term clinical studies. The incidence of enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia in these studies increased with time; however, no case of ECL cell carcinoids, dysplasia, or neoplasia have been identified in these patients. These studies, however, are of insufficient in power and duration to draw conclusions on the possible influence of long-term administration of omeprazole in the development of any premalignant or malignant conditions [FDA label]. \r\n\r\n**Other effects**\r\n\r\nSystemic effects of omeprazole in the central nervous system, cardiovascular and respiratory systems have not been found to date.

The net effect is that more pyrazinoic acid accumulates inside the bacillus at acid pH than at neutral pH. Pyrazinoic acid was thought to inhibit the enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS) I, which is required by the bacterium to synthesise fatty acids. However, this theory was thought to have been discounted.[A512] However, further studies reproduced the results of FAS I inhibition as the putative mechanism first in whole cell assay of replicating M. tuberculosis bacilli which have shown that pyrazinoic acid and its ester inhibit the synthesis of fatty acids.[A513] This study was followed by in vitro assay of tuberculous FAS I enzyme that tested the activity with pyrazinamide, pyrazinoic acid and several classes of pyrazinamide analogs.

It is ideally suited for measurement of ERPF since it has a high clearance, is essentially nontoxic at the plasma concentrations reached with recommended doses, and its analytical determination is relatively simple and accurate. Aminohippurate is also used to measure the functional capacity of the renal tubular secretory mechanism or transport maximum (Tm<sub>PAH</sub>). This is accomplished by elevating the plasma concentration to levels (40-60 mg/100 mL) sufficient to saturate the maximal capacity of the tubular cells to secrete aminohippurate. Inulin clearance is generally measured during Tm<sub>PAH</sub> determinations since glomerular filtration rate (GFR) must be known before calculations of secretory Tm measurements can be done.",

Clobazam was first synthesized in 1966 and first published in 1969, following the incidental synthesis and discovery of the first benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide in the 1950s.[A256913] Unlike older 1,4-benzodiazepines, clobazam has a better side-effects profile, particularly less sedative and amnesic effects.[A256963,A256868] This is likely because of clobazam's higher affinity to the \u03b1<sub>2</sub> subunit of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, which mediates anxiolytic effects, than the \u03b1<sub>1</sub> subunit, which mediates sedative effect.[A256868] Additionally, clobazam is believed to be a partial agonist to the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor rather than non-selective full receptor agonists like 1,4-benzodiazepines, thus potentially explaining the decreased incidence of sedative effects.[A256968,A256973]\r\n\r\nClobazam has been marketed as an anxiolytic since 1975 and an anticonvulsant since 1984.[A521,A522] In October 21, 2011, the FDA approved clobazam as an adjunctive treatment for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in adults and children aged two years and older.[A256958] In 2005, clobazam also received approval from Health Canada as an add-on therapy for generalized tonic-clonic, myoclonic, and focal impaired awareness seizures.[A256978]",

            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Clobazam belongs to the benzodiazepine class of drugs.[L44888] Clobazam acts on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor to increase GABAnergic transmission, particularly chloride conductance in neurons.[A256868] This causes neuronal hyperpolarization, resulting in an increase in the action potential threshold and reducing neuron firing frequency.[A256908, A256913] Consequently, the general neuronal activity of the central nervous system is depressed; therefore, clobazam can be used to treat diseases caused by excessive excitatory action potentials.[A256913]\r\n\r\nThe effect of clobazam 20 mg and 80 mg administered twice daily on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, evaluator-blinded, placebo-, and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) parallel thorough QT study in 280 healthy subjects. In a study with demonstrated ability to detect small effects, the upper bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval for the largest placebo-adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc based on the Fridericia correction method was below 10 ms, the threshold for regulatory concern.\r\nThus, at a dose two times the maximum recommended dose, clobazam did not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.[L44888]  ",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: Clobazam is extensively metabolized in the liver via N-demethylation and hydroxylation to form two major metabolites, N-desmethylclobazam (norclobazam) and 4'-hydroxyclobazam, respectively, with approximately 2% of the dose recovered in urine and 1% in feces as an unchanged drug.[L44888,A18648] The N-demethylation reaction is catalyzed primarily by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19 and CYP2B6. N-desmethylclobazam, an active metabolite, is the major circulating metabolite in humans, and at therapeutic doses, plasma concentrations are 3-5 times higher than those of the parent compound. Based on animal and in vitro receptor binding data, estimates of the relative potency of N-desmethylclobazam compared to the parent compound range from 1/5 to equal potency. N-desmethylclobazam is extensively hydroxylated, mainly by CYP2C19. N-desmethylclobazam and its metabolites comprise ~94% of the total drug-related components in urine.[L44888]. The formation of 4'-hydroxyclobazam is facilitated by CYP2C18 and CYP2C19.[A18648]\r\n\r\nThe polymorphic CYP2C19 is the major contributor to the metabolism of the pharmacologically active N-desmethylclobazam. In CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, levels of N-desmethylclobazam were 5-fold higher in plasma and 2- to 3-fold higher in the urine than in CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers.[L44888]  \r\n"

Specifically, the drug binds to and inhibits aromatase which is essential for the generation of estrogens from androstenedione and testosterone. A decrease in adrenal secretion of cortisol is followed by an increased secretion of pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which will overcome the blockade of adrenocortical steroid synthesis by aminoglutethimide. The compensatory increase in ACTH secretion can be suppressed by the simultaneous administration of hydrocortisone. Since aminoglutethimide increases the rate of metabolism of dexamethasone but not that of hydrocortisone, the latter is preferred as the adrenal glucocorticoid replacement. Although aminoglutethimide inhibits the synthesis of thyroxine by the thyroid gland, the compensatory increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is frequently of sufficient magnitude to overcome the inhibition of thyroid synthesis due to aminoglutethimide.

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Vinca alkaloids are structurally similar compounds composed of two multi-ringed units, _vindoline_, and _catharanthine_. _Vinorelbine tartrate_ is a vinca alkaloid in which the catharanthine component is the target of structural modification [L2005], [L2006].\r\n\r\nThis structural modification contributes to unique pharmacologic properties.The antitumor activity of vinorelbine tartrate is believed to be owed to the inhibition of mitosis at metaphase via its interaction with tubulin [L1998].\r\n\r\nVinorelbine is a mitotic spindle poison that interferes with chromosomal segregation during mitosis, also known as cell division. It pauses cells at the _G2/M_ phases, when present at concentrations close to the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). Microtubules, which are derived from polymers of tubulin, are the main target of vinorelbine. \r\n\r\nThe chemical modification used to produce vinorelbine allows for the opening of the eight-member catharanthine ring with the formation of both a covalent and reversible bond with tubulin [L2007].\r\n\r\nThe relative contribution of different microtubule-associated proteins in the production of tubulin vary between neural tissue and proliferating cells and this has important functional implications. The ability of vinorelbine to bind specifically to mitotic rather than other microtubules has been shown and may suggest that neurotoxicity is less likely to be a problem than with the molecular mechanism of action [L2007]. \r\n\r\nAs with other anti-microtubule agents, vinorelbine is known to contribute apoptosis in malignant cells. The exact mechanisms by which this process occurs are complex and many details are yet to be elucidated. The disarray of the microtubule structure has a number of effects, including the induction of tumor suppressor gene _p53_ and activation/inactivation of a number of protein kinases involved in essential signaling pathways, including _p21 WAF1/CIP1_ and _Ras/Raf_, _PKC/PKA_. These molecular changes lead to phosphorylation and consequently inactivation of the apoptosis inhibitor _Bcl2_. This, in turn, results in a decrease in the formation of heterodimers between _Bcl2_ and the pro-apoptotic gene _BAX_, stimulating the sequence of cell apoptosis [L2007].\r\n\r\nVinorelbine tartrate also possibly interferes with amino acid, cyclic AMP and glutathione metabolism, calmodulin-dependent Ca++-transport ATPase activity, cellular respiration, and nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis [L1998].\r\n",

            "metabolism": "Metabolism: \r\nVinorelbine undergoes substantial hepatic elimination in humans. Two metabolites of vinorelbine have been identified in human blood, plasma, and urine; vinorelbine N-oxide and deacetylvinorelbine. Deacetylvinorelbine has been demonstrated to be the primary metabolite of vinorelbine in humans, and has been shown to possess antitumor activity similar to vinorelbine [L2005], [L2006].\r\n\r\nVinorelbine is metabolized into two other minor metabolites, 20'-hydroxyvinorelbine and vinorelbine 6'-oxide [L2006].\r\n\r\nTherapeutic doses of vinorelbine (30 mg/m2) yield very small, if any, quantifiable levels of either metabolite in blood or urine. The metabolism of vinorelbine is mediated by hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in the CYP3A subfamily [L2004], [A32354].\r\n\r\nAs the liver provides the main route for metabolism of the drug, patients with hepatic impairment may demonstrate increased toxicity with standard dosing, however, there are no available data on this. Likewise, the contribution of cytochrome P450 enzyme action to vinorelbine metabolism has potential implications in patients receiving other drugs metabolized by this route [L2007]."

Despite its effectiveness in treating both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, clozapine was briefly removed from the market in various jurisdictions in 1970 due to severe agranulocytosis.[A256713,A256718] However, continued evidence of its effectiveness led to clozapine's eventual reintroduction, although with a reluctance to prescribe it.[A256718] \r\n\r\nClozapine was approved by the FDA in 1989 for treatment-resistant schizophrenia under the brand CLOZARIL.[L905] Due to its severe adverse effects profile, clozapine is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Clozapine REMS Program.[L905]",

The mechanism is thought to be a dose-independent and immune-mediated reaction against neutrophils.[A215557]  Patients are strictly monitored by lab testing (complete blood count with differential) to ensure agranulocytosis is detected and treated if it occurs.[L905] Testing is initially completed at one-week intervals but is expanded to two-week intervals at six months, and then four-week intervals at twelve months if lab results have been within an appropriate range. Monitoring parameters may change if there is any break in therapy. In Canada, the patient's lab values are reported to the manufacturer for hematological monitoring, and in the USA, the patient's lab values are reported to the REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program.[A215562] These programs function to notify the care provider of any significant drop in WBC/neutrophil count, or if there is a drop below a threshold level.

It is distributed by prescription for patients under 17, and over the counter for those above this age.[L7760] This levonorgestrel-only form of contraception is not indicated for regular contraception and must be taken as soon as possible within 72 hours after intercourse.[A181976,L7760] It has shown a lower efficacy when it is used off label within 96 hours.[T659]\r\n\r\n**Long-term contraception or nonemergency contraception**\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above indication in emergency contraception, levonorgestrel is combined with other contraceptives in contraceptive formulations designed for regular use, for example with ethinyl estradiol.[L7766] It is used in various hormone-releasing intrauterine devices for long-term contraception ranging for a duration of 3-5 years.[L7778,L7781,L7787] Product labeling for Mirena specifically mentions that it is recommended in women who have had at least 1 child and can be indicated for the prevention of pregnancy for up to 8 years.[L7778,L42950] A subdermal implant is also available for the prevention of pregnancy for up to 5 years.[L7823]\r\n\r\n**Hormone therapy and off-label uses**\r\n\r\nLevonorgestrel is prescribed in combination with estradiol as hormone therapy during menopause to manage vasomotor symptoms and to prevent osteoporosis.[L7805]Off-label, levonorgestrel may be used to treat menorrhagia, endometrial hyperplasia, and endometriosis.[T659]",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: **Mechanism of action on ovulation**\r\n\r\nOral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel suppress gonadotropins, inhibiting ovulation. Specifically, levonorgestrel binds to progesterone and androgen receptors and slows the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. This process results in the suppression of the normal physiological luteinizing hormone (LH) surge that precedes ovulation. It inhibits the rupture of follicles and viable egg release from the ovaries. Levonorgestrel has been proven to be more effective when administered before ovulation.[T659]\r\n\r\n**Mechanism of action in cervical mucus changes**\r\n\r\nSimilar to other levonorgestrel-containing contraceptives, the intrauterine (IUD) forms of levonorgestrel likely prevent pregnancy by increasing the thickness of cervical mucus, interfering with the movement and survival of sperm, and inducing changes in the endometrium, where a fertilized ovum is usually implanted.[L7778,L7781] Levonorgestrel is reported to alter the consistency of mucus in the cervix, which interferes with sperm migration into the uterus for fertilization. Levonorgestrel is not effective after implantation has occurred.[A181976] \r\nInterestingly, recent evidence has refuted the commonly believed notion that levonorgestrel changes the consistency of cervical mucus when it is taken over a short-term period, as in emergency contraception. Over a long-term period, however, levonorgestrel has been proven to thicken cervical mucus.[A181976] The exact mechanism of action of levonorgestrel is not completely understood and remains a topic of controversy and ongoing investigation.[A181976,L7760]\r\n\r\n*Effects on implantation**\r\n\r\nThe effects of levonorgestrel on endometrial receptivity are unclear, and the relevance of this mechanism to the therapeutic efficacy of levonorgestrel is contentious.[A175372,A218666] Prescribing information for levonorgestrel IUDs state that they exert local morphological changes to the endometrium (e.g. stromal pseudodecidualization, glandular atrophy) that may play a role in their contraceptive activity.[L7778,L7781]\r\n\r\n**Mechanism of action in hormone therapy**\r\n\r\nWhen combined with estrogens for the treatment of menopausal symptoms and prevention of osteoporosis, levonorgestrel serves to lower the carcinogenic risk of unopposed estrogen therapy via the inhibition of endometrial proliferation. Unregulated endometrial proliferation sometimes leads to endometrial cancer after estrogen use.[L7808]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Levonorgestrel prevents pregnancy by interfering with ovulation, fertilization, and implantation. The levonorgestrel-only containing emergency contraceptive tablet is 89% effective if it is used according to prescribing information within 72 hours after intercourse.[A181976,A181988] The intrauterine and implantable devices releasing levonorgestrel are more than 99% in preventing pregnancy.[A182123,L7778,L7781] Levonorgestrel utilized as a component of hormonal therapy helps to prevent endometrial carcinoma associated with unopposed estrogen administration.[A182042]",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: After absorption of the oral emergency contraceptive preparation,  levonorgestrel is conjugated and forms a large number of sulfate conjugates. In addition, glucuronide conjugates have been identified in the plasma.[A182033] High levels of conjugated and unconjugated 3\u03b1, 5\u03b2-tetrahydrolevonorgestrel are found in the plasma. The entire metabolic pathway for levonorgestrel has not been studied, however, 16\u03b2-hydroxylation is one pathway that has been identified.[L7823] Small quantities of 3\u03b1, 5\u03b1\u00ad tetrahydrolevonorgestrel and 16\u03b2hydroxylevonorgestrel are also formed.[L7760] No active metabolites have been identified.[L7793] The rate of metabolism may be considerably different according to the patient and may explain a wide variation in levonorgestrel clearance.[L7760] Liver CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 hepatic enzymes are reported to be involved in the metabolism of levonorgestrel.[A182084,L7760] "

The aerosol form of beclomethasone diproprionate is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.[L6871]\r\n\r\nIndicated for intranasal use to relieve the symptoms of seasonal or perennial allergic and nonallergic (vasomotor) rhinitis and prevent the recurrence of nasal polyps following surgical removal.[L6880]\r\n\r\nIndicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses in patients 13 years of age and older.[L10782] Corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses include psoriasis, contact dermatitis (dermatitis venenata), atopic dermatitis (infantile eczema, allergic dermatitis), neurodermatitis (lichen simplex chronicus, lichen planus, eczema, eczematous dermatitis), intertrigo, dyshidroses (pompholyx), seborrheic dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, solar dermatitis, stasis dermatitis, and anogenital and senile pruritus.[L6886]",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Beclomethasone dipropionate is a corticosteroid and prodrug that is rapidly activated by hydrolysis to the active monoester, 17 monopropionate (17-BMP), which mediates anti-inflammatory actions. 17-BMP has been shown _in vitro_ to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor which is approximately 13 times that of dexamethasone and 25 times that of beclomethasone dipropionate.[L6871] Upon binding of the ligand, the glucocorticoid receptors dimerize and translocate into the nucleus, where they subsequently bind to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) on glucocorticoid-responsive genes, leading to changes in transcription. There are several proposed mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory action of corticosteroids. Corticosteroids may work by increasing the transcription of genes coding for anti-inflammatory proteins, including lipocortin-1 and interleukin-10.[A179875] Corticosteroids were also shown to inhibit the expression of multiple genes that encode pro-inflammatory factors, such as cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules, that are activated during the chronic inflammatory process.[A31449] This is thought to be due to the direct inhibitory interaction between activated glucocorticoid receptors and activated pro-inflammatory transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-kappa B and activator protein-1.[A179875] Chronic inflammation is often characterized by enhanced expression of these transcription factors that bind to and activate coactivator molecules, which then acetylate core histones to switch on gene transcription to further amplify the inflammatory process.[A31449] Corticosteroids suppress the multiple inflammatory gene expression by promoting histone deacetylation, resulting in tighter coiling of DNA and reduced access of transcription factors to their binding sites.[A179875] ",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Inflammatory conditions, including asthma, dermatoses, and allergic rhinitis, involve the activation of cascades by inflammatory mediators. Inflammation is a primary defense mechanism and the homeostatic response of the immune system; however, a prolonged inflammatory response in certain disorders may lead to tissue damage, pain, and swelling. Beclomethasone dipropionate works by attenuating the inflammatory responses associated with asthma, allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, and corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. It suppresses the actions of inflammatory cells, such as mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. It also inhibits the release of inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines.[L6871] Beclomethasone dipropionate is reported to exhibit potent topical activity while possessing low systemic effects.[A179845] \r\n\r\nBeclomethasone dipropionate is a corticosteroid drug with anti-inflammatory and vasoconstrictive effects used to treat chronic inflammatory processes such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. When inhaled, it improves lung function, decreases airway hyper-reactivity, and reduces the severity of asthmatic symptoms.[A180160] Although inhaled corticosteroids, including beclomethasone dipropionate, are reported to mainly act locally in the lungs, systemic effects such as disruption of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function, bone turnover, osteoporosis, and growth suppression may still be observed with chronic use or high dose administration. There were varying findings from clinical studies examining the effect of beclomethasone dipropionate on growth suppression in pediatric patients.[A180160] It was shown to suppress the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in a dose-dependent manner.[A179917] HPA axis is a central hormonal response system to stress and activation of HPA axis leads to the production of endogenous steroid hormone production.[A179920] Long-term use of high-dose systemic corticosteroids, including those inhaled, was often associated with signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to stress conditions, such as trauma, surgery, or infections. As corticosteroids work by suppressing the immune system, there may be an increased risk for developing infections.[L6871] Cases of _Candida albicans_ infection of the mouth and throat have been reported with inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate therapy.[A180010]",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: During absorption, beclomethasone dipropionate is undergoes rapid and extensive hydrolysis mediated by esterases CYP3A to form beclomethasone-17-monopropionate (17-BMP), beclomethasone-21-monopropionate (21-BMP), and beclomethasone (BOH). 17-BMP is the major active metabolite with the most potent anti-inflammatory activity.[L6871] About 95% of the total beclomethasone dipropionate administered via oral inhalation undergoes presystemic conversion to form 17-BMP in the lung.[A179839]"

As a result of its binding its associated steroid hormone, progesterone, the progesterone receptor (PR) modulates the expression of genes that regulate the development, differentiation, and proliferation of target tissues [A175666]. In humans, PR is found to be highly expressed in the stromal (connective tissue) cells during the secretory phase and during pregnancy [A175651]. \r\n\r\nProgesterone may prevent pregnancy by changing the consistency of cervical mucus to be unfavorable for sperm penetration, and by inhibiting follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which normally causes ovulation.  With perfect use, the first-year failure rate for progestin-only oral contraceptives is approximately 0.5%. The typical failure rate, however, is estimated to be approximately 5%, due to late or missed pills [F3904].",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Progesterone, depending on concentration and dosage form, and timing of exposure may have several pharmacodynamic effects.  These actions, according, to various preparations, are listed below:\r\n\r\nGeneral effects\r\n\r\nProgesterone is the main hormone of the corpus luteum and the placenta. It acts on the uterus by changing the proliferative phase to the secretory phase of the endometrium (inner mucous lining of the uterus).   This hormone, stimulated by a hormone called _luteinizing hormone_ (LH) is the main hormone during the secretory phase to prepare the corpus luteum and the endometrium for implantation of a fertilized ovum. As the luteal phase concludes, the progesterone hormone sends negative feedback to the anterior pituitary gland in the brain to decrease FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone) levels. This prevents ovulation and maturation of oocytes (immature egg cells). The endometrium then prepares for pregnancy by increasing its vascularity (blood vessels) and stimulating mucous secretion. This process occurs by progesterone stimulating the endometrium to decrease endometrial proliferation, leading to a decreased uterine lining thickness, developing more complex uterine glands, collecting energy in the form of glycogen, and providing more uterine blood vessel surface area suitable for supporting a growing embryo. As opposed to cervical mucous changes observed during the proliferative phase and ovulation, progesterone decreases and thickens the cervical mucus, rendering it less elastic. This change occurs because the fertilization time period has passed, and a specific consistency of mucous amenable to sperm entry is no longer required [T490].\r\n\r\n**Gelatinized capsules**\r\n\r\nProgesterone capsules are an oral dosage form of micronized progesterone which, chemically identical to progesterone of ovarian origin. Progesterone capsules have all the properties of endogenous progesterone with induction of a secretory phase endometrium with gestagenic, antiestrogenic, slightly antiandrogenic and anti-aldosterone effects [F3913]. Progesterone opposes the effects of estrogen on the uterus, and is beneficial in women with unopposed estrogen exposure, which carries an increased risk of malignancy [F3913].\r\n\r\n\r\n**Vaginal gel and vaginal insert**\r\n\r\n The gel preparation mimics the effects of naturally occurring progesterone. In the presence of adequate levels of estrogen, progesterone converts a proliferative endometrium into secretory endometrium. This means that the endometrium changes from a growing and thickening stage into a subsequent preparation stage for pregnancy, which involves further preparatory changes. Progesterone is necessary for the development of decidual tissue (specialized tissue amenable to supporting a possible pregnancy). Progesterone is required to increase endometrial receptivity for the implantation of a fertilized embryo. Once an embryo is implanted, progesterone helps to maintain the pregnancy [F3898]. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Injection (intramuscular)**\r\n\r\n Intramuscularly injected progesterone increases serum progesterone and aids in the prevention of endometrial tissue overgrowth due to unopposed estrogen (which leads to abnormal uterine bleeding and sometimes uterine cancer) [L5638], [F3916]. In the absence or deficiency of progesterone, the endometrium continually proliferates, eventually outgrowing its limited blood supply, shedding incompletely, and leading to abnormal and/or profuse bleeding as well as malignancy [L5638].\r\n\r\n**Tablets, contraceptive**\r\n\r\nProgesterone-only contraceptive tablets prevent conception by suppressing ovulation in about half of users, causing a thickening of cervical mucus to inhibit sperm movement, lowering the midcycle LH and FSH hormone peaks, slowing the movement of the ovum through the fallopian tubes, and causing secretory changes in the endometrium as described above [F3904].",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: Progesterone is mainly metabolized by the liver. After oral administration, the major plasma metabolites found are 20 a hydroxy-\u03944 a-prenolone and 5 a-dihydroprogesterone. Some progesterone metabolites are found excreted in the bile and these metabolites may be deconjugated and subsequently metabolized in the gut by reduction, dehydroxylation, and epimerization [FDA label]. The major plasma and urinary metabolites are comparable to those found during the physiological progesterone secretion of the corpus luteum [F3913]. "

It is the active stereoisomer of zopiclone, belonging to the class of drugs known as _cyclopyrrolones_.[A179638,L6850] Cyclopyrrolone drugs demonstrate high efficacy and low toxicity[A179827], offering a safer alternative to other drugs used for insomnia.\r\n\r\nOne major benefit of eszopiclone is that it is approved by the FDA for the long-term treatment of insomnia. This sets it apart from many other hypnotic sedatives, which are generally approved only for the relief of short-term (6-8 weeks) insomnia. Eszopiclone was initially approved by the FDA in 2004.[L6769]",

            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Eszopiclone rapidly induces sleep and decreases sleep latency. It also aids in the maintenance of sleep, preventing frequent awakenings.[A179659,A179662,L6769] This drug has shown anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant properties in animals but is used in humans for its sedating effects.[A179827]\r\n\r\nEszopiclone is a central nervous system depressant with various effects. These include changes in alertness and motor coordination and the risk of next morning impairment, increasing with the amount of eszopiclone administered.  Exercise caution and advise against driving a motor vehicle or activities that require full mental alertness the next morning.[L6769] Complex sleep behaviors may result from eszopiclone use. Eszopiclone should be discontinued in these cases.[L6874] Avoid the use of alcohol and other CNS depressants when eszopiclone is administered. Advise patients to skip the eszopiclone dose if alcohol has been consumed before bed or during the evening. Use the smallest dose of eszopiclone as possible, especially in elderly patients, who may experience exaggerated drug effects. Though the potential for dependence and abuse with eszopiclone is lower than for other hypnotic drugs, this drug has been abused and is known to cause dependence.[L6868]",

Cholecystokinin is secreted by the duodenum when fat- or protein-rich chyme leaves the stomach and enters the duodenum. The hormone acts on the pancreas to stimulate the secretion of the enzymes lipase, amylase, trypsin, and chymotrypsin. Together these pancreatic enzymes catalyze the digestion of fat and protein. Cholecystokinin also stimulates both the contraction of the gall bladder, and the relaxtion of the Sphincter of Oddi (Glisson's Sphinctor), which delivers, (not secretes) bile into the small intestine.

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Neurotransmission relies on excitatory and inhibitory signalling. \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type-A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) are members of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (PLGIC) superfamily located synaptically and perisynaptically to mediate phasic inhibition and extrasynaptically to mediate tonic inhibition. GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs comprise a variety of subunits from a homologous family whose members are named based on sequence identity as one of \u03b11-6, \u03b21-3, \u03b31-3, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b8, \u03c0, and \u03c11-3. Each subunit possesses an extracellular (ECD), transmembrane (TMD), and intracellular (ICD) domain; inter-subunit interfaces are the primary points of neurotransmitter and modulator binding, described by coordination of the principal (+) and complementary (-) sites in each subunit. Binding of GABA to GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs induces pore opening, rapid flow of chloride ions, and synaptic hyperpolarization, which in turn manifests as an inhibitory signal.[A236793, A236798]\r\n\r\nThe most prevalent GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs _in vivo_ are the \u03b11\u03b22\u03b32 receptors, which contain both GABA (\u03b2+/\u03b1-) and benzodiazepine (BZD, \u03b1+/\u03b3-) binding sites in the intersubunit interfaces of the relevant subunits.[A236793, A236798, A236828] In general, any receptors containing an \u03b1<sub>x</sub>/\u03b3<sub>z</sub> interface, where x = 1-3,5 and z = 1-3, have potential high-affinity BZD binding sites, although small sequence differences between subunits may alter binding affinity to individual molecules. The \u03b14 and \u03b16 subunits, in which an otherwise conserved histidine is replaced by arginine, do not bind traditional BZD ligands such as diazepam and hence are considered \"diazepam-insensitive\".[A236793, A236798, A236828] GABA binding results in a series of conformational changes in the ECDs of GABA<sub>A</sub>R \u03b2 subunits, \"locking\" each to its neighbouring \u03b1- interface. The binding of alprazolam in the high-affinity BZD site stabilizes the \u03b1+/\u03b3- interface and facilitates the conformational changes that lead to pore opening, hence functioning as a positive allosteric modulator.[A236833]\r\n\r\nThe exact manner in which GABA<sub>A</sub>R allosteric modulation mediates the therapeutic and unwanted effects of benzodiazepines remains unclear.[A177973, A18125] Earlier studies suggested that the primary factor was the \u03b1 subunit composition, with \u03b11-containing receptors mediating the sedative effects, \u03b12/3-containing receptors the anxiolytic effects, and \u03b15-containing receptors the memory effects of benzodiazepines.[A236838] More recent studies suggest a more complex set of factors including subunit composition, physiological location, neuronal circuit, and nerve cell type.[A236843] To further complicate matters, there may be up to five distinct BZD binding sites on GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, with site 1 corresponding to the classical high-affinity \u03b1+/\u03b3- interface. The effects of binding at sites 2-4 are not fully understood and likely impart greater complexity to benzodiazepine pharmacological action.[A236798, A236828]",

Patients with pre-existing impaired respiratory function are at increased risk of adverse effects including death during treatment with benzodiazepines. In addition, due to its CNS depressant effects, patients taking alprazolam should avoid operating heavy machinery or driving and should avoid other CNS depressants such as alcohol. As with other benzodiazepines, alprazolam carries a risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which is higher in predisposed individuals and may require strict monitoring. Cessation of therapy may result in acute or protracted withdrawal symptoms, which may be life-threatening; the patient dose should be gradually tapered whenever discontinuation or reduced dosage are necessary. Newborns born to mothers using alprazolam later in pregnancy may suffer from sedation and withdrawal symptoms. As CYP3A is required for the initial step in alprazolam metabolism, alprazolam is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and itraconazole; milder CYP3A inhibitors still necessitate alprazolam dosage adjustments. Lastly, benzodiazepines may have negative effects, such as panic disorders, increased suicide incidence, and episodes of mania/hypomania, in patients suffering from depression.[A18125, A236788, L34783, L34788]",

A similar cell penetration and DNA binding process is thought to take place for fungal cells as well. Because Gentian violet is a mutagen and mitotic poison, cell growth is consequently inhibited. A photodynamic action of gentian violet, apparently mediated by a free-radical mechanism, has recently been described in bacteria and in the protozoan T. cruzi. Evidence also suggests that gentian violet dissipates the bacterial (and mitochondrial) membrane potential by inducing permeability. This is followed by respiratory inhibition.

            "summary": "Pramipexole is a drug used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD).  It is a _non-ergot dopamine agonist_ drug that is efficacious in treating various Parkinson's symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia (slow movement) [A176867]. It was first approved by the FDA in 1997 [L5882]. Parkinson's Disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders and causes a high level of disability in patients [A176855], leading to increased difficulty in performing activities of daily living due to symptoms that progress over time [A176858]. The prevalence of Parkinson's Disease worldwide has increased from approximately 2.5 million in 1990 to about 6.1 million in 2016 [A176861].  This increase may be attributed to an aging population along with other contributing factors [A176861].\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above FDA approval for Parkinson's Disease, pramipexole was also approved by the FDA in 2006 for the treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) [A176873]. RLS is a sleep-related disorder characterized by unpleasant sensations in the lower extremities, often accompanied by an uncontrollable urge to move the legs [A176876].",

",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: The exact mechanism of action of pramipexole as a treatment for Parkinson's disease is unknown at this time. It is thought, however, that the ability of pramipexole to cause stimulation of the dopamine receptors in the striatum of the brain, a region that receives a vast array of neurological input and is responsible for a wide variety of functions, may be involved[A176891].  Studies performed in animals show that pramipexole influences striatal neuronal transmission rates following activation of dopamine receptors  [FDA label]. \r\n\r\nPramipexole is considered a non-ergot dopamine agonist that shows specificity and strong activity at the D2 subfamily of dopamine receptors in vitro, binding selectively and dopamine D2 receptors and showing a preference for the dopamine D3 receptor subtype rather than other subtypes [A176873]. The clinical significance of this binding specificity is unknown [FDA label], [A176873]. \r\n",

Dopamine is an essential neurotransmitter that has major effects on motor movements in humans.\r\n\r\n**Restless Legs Syndrome**\r\n\r\nPramipexole likely restores balance to the dopaminergic system, controlling the symptoms of this condition. Restless legs syndrome is thought to occur, in part, through dysfunction of the dopaminergic system, resulting in unpleasant lower extremity symptoms [A176876], [F4301]. \r\n\r\n**Other effects**\r\n\r\nIn addition to the abovementioned effects, animal studies demonstrate that pramipexole blocks dopamine synthesis, release, and turnover. Additionally, this drug is neuroprotective to dopamine neuron degeneration after ischemia or methamphetamine neurotoxicity [F4301]. ",

The goal of treatment with miglustat is to reduce the rate of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis so that the amount of glycosphingolipid substrate is reduced to a level which allows the residual activity of the deficient glucocerebrosidase enzyme to be more effective (substrate reduction therapy), reducing the accumulation of glucocerebroside in macrophages. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that miglustat can reduce the synthesis of glucosylceramide-based glycosphingolipids. In clinical trials, miglustat improved liver and spleen volume, as well as hemoglobin concentration and platelet count. Inhibition of glycosphingolipid synthesis has also shown to reduce intracellular lipid storage, improve fluid-phase endosomal uptake and normalize lipid transport in peripheral blood B lymphocytes of NP-C patients, which results in a decrease in the potentially neurotoxic accumulation of gnagliosides G<sub>M2</sub> and G<sub>M3</sub>, lactosylceramide and glucosylceramide, possibly preventing further neuronal damage. Other studies have also suggested that miglustat may indirectly modulate intracellular calcium homeostasis through its effects on glucosylceramide levels, and evidence has shown that an initiating factor in the pathogenesis of NP-C may be impaired calcium homeostasis related to sphingosine storage. Therefore, the effect that miglustat exerts on intracellular calcium levels may influence an important underlying pathogenic mechanism of NP-C.",

Glucosylceramide is a substrate for the endogenous glucocerebrosidase, an enzyme that is deficient in Gaucher's disease. The accumulation of glucosylceramide due to the absence of glucocerebrosidase results in the storage of this material in the lysosomes of tissue macrophages, leading to widespread pathology due to infiltration of lipid-engorged macrophages in the viscera, lymph nodes, and bone marrow.

            "summary": "Methylphenidate is a central nervous system stimulant used most commonly in the treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and for narcolepsy. Also known as the marketed products Ritalin, Concerta, or Biphentin, methylphenidate is used with other treatment modalities (psychological, educational, cognitive behaviour therapy, etc) to improve the following group of developmentally inappropriate symptoms associated with ADHD: moderate-to-severe distractibility, short attention span, hyperactivity, emotional lability, and impulsivity. Long-acting formulations of psychostimulants such as methylphenidate, [DB01576], and [DB01255] are considered the most effective and widely used treatment for ADHD, and are considered first-line options for children, adolescents, and adults as recommended by CADDRA (Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance). [L6037] CADDRA recommends the use of methylphenidate due to long term studies, of over twenty years in duration, which show methylphenidate is safe and effective.  \r\n\r\nWhile its exact mechanism is unclear, methylphenidate (MPH) has been shown to act as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), thereby increasing the presence of these neurotransmitters in the extraneuronal space and prolonging their action.[A177541] There is a dose-related effect of psychostimulants on receptor stimulation, where higher doses are shown to increase norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) efflux throughout the brain which can result in impaired cognition and locomotor-activating effects. In contrast, low doses are found to selectively activate NE and DA neurotransmission within the prefrontal cortex which is an area of the brain thought to play a prominent role in ADHD pathophysiology, thereby improving clinical efficacy and preventing side effects.[A177547] The lower doses used to treat ADHD are not associated with the locomotor-activating effects associated with higher doses and instead reduce movement, impulsivity, and increase cognitive function including sustained attention and working memory.[A177541, A177544] Methylphenidate's beneficial effects in sustaining attention have also been shown to be mediated by alpha-1 adrenergic receptor activity.[A177550] Clinical findings have shown that children with ADHD have an abnormality in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1), the D4 receptor gene (DRD-4), and/or the D2 receptor gene that may be at least partly overcome by the dopaminergic effects of methylphenidate, suggesting a possible mode of action.[F4474]\r\n\r\nWhen provided as Biphentin\u00ae, methylphenidate is released through a multi-layer release delivery system (MLRTM) where 40% of the dose is provided as an immediate release and 60% is provided through a gradual release. Biphentin was designed to be an alternative to separate doses of immediate-release (IR) methylphenidate by providing a biphasic concentration-time profile when given as a single dose. The MLRTM release system allows for a sustained effect for 10-12 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing that covers the major times that ADHD impairment might occur (such as school, homework periods, during the work day, etc).\r\n\r\nWhen provided as Concerta\u00ae, methylphenidate is released through the patented Osmotic Controlled-Release Oral Delivery (OROS) system where 22% of the dose is provided as an immediate release and 78% is provided through a gradual release.[A631] OROS is comprised of an osmotically active trilayer core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane with an immediate-release drug overcoat. Within an aqueous environment, such as the stomach, the drug overcoat, which consists of 22% of the dose, dissolves within one hour, providing an initial immediate-release formulation of methylphenidate. Water then permeates through the membrane into the tablet core where the osmotically active polymer excipients expand, allowing methylphenidate to release slowly through the orifice over a period of 6-7 hours. Concerta also provides a sustained 10-12 hour effect, allowing for once-daily dosing.\r\n\r\nMethylphenidate contains a blackbox warning stating that CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate-containing products and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. This abuse potential is likely related to the effects associated with higher doses of methylphenidate, which induce surface expression of the dopamine transporter (DAT).[A177553] In particular, increased dopamine in key brain areas is associated with the reinforcing and addictive properties of psychostimulants such as methylphenidate, and even amplifies the potency and reinforcing effects of other drugs of abuse such as amphetamines, making ADHD sufferers more susceptible to their addictive effects.[A177556] Concerns about abuse potential have spurred research into medications with fewer effects on DAT and the use of non-stimulant ADHD medications including [DB00289] and [DB01018].",

            "summary": "Zolpidem, also known as _Ambien_, is a hypnotic drug that was initially approved by the FDA in 1992 [FDA label].  Zolpidem improves sleep in patients with insomnia. It is aimed for use in patients with difficulties initiating sleep. This drug decreases the time to fall asleep (sleep latency), increases the duration of sleep, and decreases the number of awakenings during sleep in patients with temporary (transient) insomnia.  It is available in both immediate acting and extended release forms [FDA label], [F3802]. \r\n\r\nIts tolerability profile is favorable when administered according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, with a low risk of drug withdrawal, drug dependence, and drug tolerance [A175426]. In addition, zolpidem improves sleep quality in patients suffering from chronic insomnia and can show mild muscle relaxant properties [L5584]. Research also shows that zolpidem is rapid and effective in restoring brain function for patients in a vegetative state following brain injury. This drug has the propensity to completely or partially reverse the abnormal metabolism of damaged brain cells after injury [L5584], [A175444].",
            "indication": "Indication: This drug is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia in adults characterized by difficulties with sleep initiation [FDA label]. ",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: \r\nZolpidem, the active moiety of zolpidem tartrate, is a hypnotic substance with a chemical structure that is not related to the structure benzodiazepines, barbiturates, pyrrolopyrazines, pyrazolopyrimidines or other drugs exerting hypnotic effects. It interacts with a _GABA-BZ_ receptor complex and shares various pharmacological properties with the _benzodiazepine_ class of drugs [FDA label].\r\n\r\nSubunit binding of the _GABAA_ receptor chloride channel macromolecular complex is thought to lead to the sedative, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and myorelaxant drug effects of zolpidem. The main regulatory site of the GABAA receptor complex can be found on its _alpha (\u03b1) subunit_ and is called the _benzodiazepine_ (BZ) or _omega (\u03c9)_ receptor. At least three different subtypes of the (\u03c9) receptor have been identified to this date [FDA label].\r\n\r\nIn contrast to benzodiazepine drugs, which are found to modulate all benzodiazepine receptor subtypes in a non-selective fashion, zolpidem binds the (BZ1) receptor specifically with a potent affinity for the alpha 1/alpha 5 subunits (in vitro) [FDA label].   More recent studies suggest that zolpidem binds primarily to the alpha 1, 2, and 3 subunits of the GABA receptor [A173896], [A10523], [A175567], and not the alpha 5 subunit. \r\n\r\nThe (_BZ1_) receptor is found primarily on the Lamina IV of the brain sensorimotor cortical regions, substantia nigra (pars reticulata), cerebellum molecular layer, olfactory bulb, ventral thalamic complex, pons, inferior colliculus, and globus pallidus. Specific and selective binding of zolpidem on the (BZ1) receptor is not considered absolute, however, this binding could potentially explain the relative lack of myorelaxant and anticonvulsant activity in animal studies in addition to the preservation of deep sleep (stages 3 and 4) in human studies of zolpidem at hypnotic doses [FDA label]. ",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: **Effects on the central nervous system (CNS)**\r\n\r\nThis drug has CNS depressant effects, which may include somnolence, decreased alertness, sedation, drowsiness, dizziness,  and other changes in psychomotor function [FDA label].  Due to the above effects, the FDA has recommended an initial dose of zolpidem (immediate-acting) is a single dose of 5 mg for women and a single dose of 5 or 10 mg for men, immediately before bedtime with at least 7-8 hours remaining before the planned time of awakening [L5581]. Refer to product labeling for detailed information [F3802], [FDA label]. \r\n\r\n**Effects on memory**\r\n\r\nControlled studies in adults using objective measures of memory demonstrated no significant evidence of next-day memory impairment after the administration of zolpidem. On the contrary, in a clinical study involving the administration of zolpidem doses of 10 and 20 mg, a  marked reduction in a next-morning recall of information relayed to subjects during peak drug effect (90 minutes after dosing) was observed. These subjects experienced a condition known as _anterograde amnesia_. Subjective evidence from adverse event data has suggested that anterograde amnesia may occur after zolpidem administration, mainly at doses above 10 mg [FDA label].\r\n\r\n**Effects on psychomotor function**\r\n\r\nThis drug may cause decreased psychomotor performance. Additive psychomotor effects may occur with other drugs that cause depression of psychomotor function, including alcohol [FDA label]. Patients taking zolpidem should be cautioned against participating in hazardous activities or occupations requiring complete mental alertness or motor coordination, including operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle after ingesting the drug. Potential impairment of the performance of the above types of activities may also occur the day after zolpidem ingestion, especially at higher doses and ingestion of the extended-release form [FDA label], [F3802]. \r\n\r\n**Effects on insomnia and sleep stages**\r\n\r\nEvidence suggests that this drug is associated with minimal rebound insomnia. During clinical trials with patients using zolpidem on an \u2018as-needed\u2019 basis, zolpidem use resulted in global improvements in sleep [A175426]. Zolpidem has been demonstrated to decrease sleep latency (the time it takes to fall asleep) for up to 35 days in controlled clinical studies [FDA label]. In studies measuring the percentage of sleep time spent in each sleep stage, zolpidem has primarily been shown to preserve sleep stages. Sleep time spent in stages 3 and 4 (deep sleep) was measured as similar to placebo with only minor and inconsistent changes in REM (paradoxical) sleep at the recommended dose [FDA label].\r\n\r\n**Next-day residual effects**\r\n\r\n In 2013, the FDA issued a statement warning that patients who take zolpidem extended-release (Ambien CR)\u2015either 6.25 mg or 12.5 mg\u2015should not drive or participate in other activities requiring full mental alertness the day after taking the drug, due to the fact that zolpidem concentrations can remain increased the next day, and impair the ability to perform these activities [L5581], [F3802].  Patients may decrease their risk of next-morning impairment by taking the lowest dose of their insomnia medicine that treats their symptoms, according to the FDA [L5590]. Specific dosing recommendations for both men and women are included in this statement [L5581]. This information is also available on product labeling [F3802], [FDA label]. \r\n\r\n**Rebound effects**\r\n\r\n There was no polysomnographic (objective) evidence of rebound insomnia at normal doses,  in studies evaluating sleep on the nights following discontinuation of zolpidem tartrate. Subjective evidence of impaired sleep in the elderly on the first post-treatment night was observed at doses higher than the recommended 5mg dose for elderly patients [FDA label]. ",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: \r\nZolpidem is metabolized to three pharmacologically by various hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes, mainly CYP3A4, but also CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 [A175429], [A175447].\r\nAlthough zolpidem is heavily metabolized, all three metabolites are inactive [A175426]. \r\n\r\nThe major metabolic routes in humans are oxidation of the methyl group on the phenyl ring or the methyl group on the imidazopyridine moiety, to produce carboxylic acids (metabolites I and II), and hydroxylation of one of the imidazopyridine groups (to produce metabolite X). Another less common pathway is by the oxidation of the methyl groups on the substituted amide [A175429]. "

It displays effective antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2 [A35271]. \r\n\r\nThe combination product of trifluridine with tipiracil marketed as Lonsurf has been approved in Japan, the United States, and the European Union for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have been previously treated with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, an anti-VEGF biological therapy, and if RAS wild-type, an anti-EGFR therapy. In the anticancer therapy, trifluridine acts as a thymidine-based nucleoside metabolic inhibitor that gets incorporated into DNA of cancer cells following cell uptake to aberrate DNA function during cell replication [F649].",

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: The mechanism of action of trifluridine as an antiviral agent has not been fully elucidated, but appears to involve the inhibition of viral replication. Trifluridine gets incorporated into viral DNA during replication, which leads to the formation of defective proteins and an increased mutation rate. Trifluridine also mediates antineoplastic activities via this mechanism; following uptake into cancer cells, trifluridine is rapidly phosphorylated by thymidine kinase to its active monophosphate form [A35272]. Subsequent phosphorylation produces trifluridine triphosphate [A35272], which is readily incorporated into the DNA of tumour cells in place of thymidine bases to perturb DNA function, DNA synthesis, and tumour cell proliferation [FDA Label]. As trifluridine is subject to rapid degradation by TPase and readily metabolised by a first-pass effect following oral administration, tipiracil is added in the antineoplastic combination product as an inhibitor of TPase to increase the bioavailability of trifluridine [F649]. Trifluridine monophosphate also reversibly inhibits thymidylate synthetase (TS), an enzyme that is necessary for DNA synthesis and which levels are shown to be elevated different cancer cell lines [A35289]. Up-regulation of the expression of the TS enzyme may also lead to the resistance to antineoplastic therapies, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). [A35289 However, this inhibitory effect is not considered to be sufficient enough to fully contribute to the cytotoxicity in cancer cells. [A35272]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Trifluridine exhibits an antiviral effect against herpes simplex virus, types 1 and 2 and vacciniavirus both in vitro and in vivo [A35271]. Some strains of adenovirus that contribute to the pathology of keratoconjunctivitis were shown to be susceptible to trifluridine _in vitro_ [A35271]. While there is evidence from a study that cross-resistance may develop between trifluridine and [idoxuridine] or [vidarabine], trifluridine was shown to effective in treating dendritic ulcers in patients with herpetic keratitis who are unresponsive to [idoxuridine] or [vidarabine] based on the results from masked comparative trials [A35271]. In nonclinical studies, trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride demonstrated antitumour activity against both 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) sensitive and resistant colorectal cancer cell lines [F649]. The cytotoxic activity of trifluridine and tipiracil against several human tumour xenografts show high correlation with the amount of trifluridine incorporated into DNA, indicating that the primary mechanism of action of trifluridine involves the direct incorporation into the cancer cell DNA [F649]. Trifluridine and tipiracil demonstrated anti-tumor activity against KRAS wild-type and mutant human colorectal cancer xenografts in mice [FDA Label]. \r\n\r\nIn clinical studies comprised of patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer, treatment of trifluridine in combination with tipiracil in addition to best supportive care over a 5- or 7-month period resulted in increased progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) compared to placebo [F649]. In an open-label study, administration of trifluridine at the recommended dosage in patients with advanced solid tumors had no clinically relevant effect on QT/QTc prolongation compared with placebo [FDA Label].

After ingestion, allopurinol is metabolized to its active metabolite, oxypurinol (_alloxanthine_) in the liver [T508], which acts as an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase enzyme [FDA label]. \r\n\r\nAllopurinol and its active metabolite inhibit xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that converts hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. Inhibition of this enzyme is responsible for the effects of allopurinol. This drug increases the reutilization of hypoxanthine and xanthine for nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis by a process that involves the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase).  This process results in an increased nucleotide concentration, which causes feedback inhibition of de novo purine synthesis. The end result is decreased urine and serum uric acid concentrations [F3988], which decreases the incidence of gout symptoms. \r\n\r\nAccompanying the reduction of serum uric acid by allopurinol is an increase in the serum and urine concentrations of hypoxanthine and xanthine (due to inhibition of xanthine oxidase).  In the absence of allopurinol, regular urinary excretion of oxypurines almost entirely occurs in the form of uric acid. After the ingestion of allopurinol, the contents of excreted urine are hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid. Because each substance has its own individual solubility, the concentration of uric acid in plasma is decreased without exposing the renal tissues to a high load of uric acid, thereby decreasing the risk of crystalluria. By lowering the uric acid concentration in the plasma below its limits of solubility, allopurinol encourages the dissolution of gout tophi. Although the levels of hypoxanthine and xanthine are found to be increased after allopurinol ingestion, the risk of deposition in renal tissues is less than that of uric acid, as they become more soluble and are rapidly excreted by the kidney [F3988].

It displayed schedule-dependent antitumour activity in various animal models and xenografts from human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer.[A233140] Therefore, the antineoplastic effects of gemcitabine are enhanced through prolonged infusion time rather than higher dosage.[A233140] Gemcitabine inhibited the growth of human xenografts from carcinoma of the lung, pancreas, ovaries, head and neck, and breast. In mice, gemcitabine inhibited the growth of human tumour xenografts from the breast, colon, lung or pancreas by 69 to 99%. In clinical trials of advanced NSCLC, gemcitabine monotherapy produced objective response rates ranging from 18 to 26%, with a median duration of response ranging from 3.3 to 12.7 months. Overall median survival time was 6.2 to 12.3 months. The combined use of cisplatin and gemcitabine produced better objective response rates compared to monotherapy.

Without sufficient quantities of circulating thyroid hormones, symptoms of hypothyroidism begin to develop such as fatigue, increased heart rate, depression[A179620], dry skin and hair, muscle cramps, constipation, weight gain, memory impairment, and poor tolerance to cold temperatures.[F4636,A35722]\r\n\r\nIn response to Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) release by the pituitary gland, a normally functioning thyroid gland will produce and secrete T<sub>4</sub>, which is then converted through deiodination (by type I or type II 5\u2032-deiodinases)[A179941] into its active metabolite T<sub>3</sub>. While T<sub>4</sub> is the major product secreted by the thyroid gland,  T<sub>3</sub> exerts the majority of the physiological effects of the thyroid hormones; T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> have a relative potency of ~1:4 (T4:T3).[F4633] T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> act on nearly every cell of the body, but have a particularly strong effect on the cardiac system.[A179935] As a result, many cardiac functions including heart rate, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance are closely linked to thyroid status.[A179938]\r\n\r\nPrior to the development of levothyroxine, [DB09100] or desiccated thyroid, used to be the mainstay of treatment for hypothyroidism.

Desiccated thyroid products contain a ratio of T4 to T3 of 4.2:1, which is significantly lower than the 14:1 ratio of secretion by the human thyroid gland. This higher proportion of T3 in desiccated thyroid products can lead to supraphysiologic levels of T3 which may put patients at risk of thyrotoxicosis if thyroid extract therapy is not adjusted according to the serum TSH.[A35722, F4636]",

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Levothyroxine is a synthetically prepared levo-isomer of the thyroid hormone thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>, a tetra-iodinated tyrosine derivative) that acts as a replacement in deficiency syndromes such as hypothyroidism. T<sub>4</sub> is the major hormone secreted from the thyroid gland and is chemically identical to the naturally secreted T<sub>4</sub>: it increases metabolic rate, decreases thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) production from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland, and, in peripheral tissues, is converted to T<sub>3</sub>. Thyroxine is released from its precursor protein thyroglobulin through proteolysis and secreted into the blood where is it then peripherally deiodinated to form triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>) which exerts a broad spectrum of stimulatory effects on cell metabolism. T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> have a relative potency of ~1:4. \r\n\r\nThyroid hormone increases the metabolic rate of cells of all tissues in the body. In the fetus and newborn, thyroid hormone is important for the growth and development of all tissues including bones and the brain. In adults, thyroid hormone helps to maintain brain function, food metabolism, and body temperature, among other effects. The symptoms of thyroid deficiency relieved by levothyroxine include slow speech, lack of energy, weight gain, hair loss, dry thick skin and unusual sensitivity to cold.\r\n\r\nThe thyroid hormones have been shown to exert both genomic and non-genomic effects.[A179950] They exert their genomic effects by diffusing into the cell nucleus and binding to thyroid hormone receptors in DNA regions called thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) near genes.[A179605] This complex of T<sub>4</sub>, T<sub>3</sub>, DNA, and other coregulatory proteins causes a conformational change and a resulting shift in transcriptional regulation of nearby genes, synthesis of messenger RNA, and cytoplasmic protein production.[A179605,A179935] For example, in cardiac tissues T<sub>3</sub> has been shown to regulate the genes for \u03b1- and \u03b2-myosin heavy chains, production of the sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins calcium-activated ATPase (Ca2+-ATPase) and phospholamban, \u03b2-adrenergic receptors, guanine-nucleotide regulatory proteins, and adenylyl cyclase types V and VI as well as several plasma-membrane ion transporters, such as Na+/K+\u2013ATPase, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, and voltage-gated potassium channels, including Kv1.5, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3. [A179938] As a result, many cardiac functions including heart rate, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance are closely linked to thyroid status.\r\n\r\nThe non-genomic actions of the thyroid hormones have been shown to occur through binding to a plasma membrane receptor integrin aVb3 at the Arg-Gly-Asp recognition site.[A179959] From the cell-surface, T<sub>4</sub> binding to integrin results in down-stream effects including activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; ERK1/2) and causes subsequent effects on cellular/nuclear events including angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation.[A179935, A179956]",

The dose of levothyroxine should be titrated slowly and carefully and patients should be monitored for their response to titration to avoid these effects. TSH levels should be monitored at least yearly to avoid over-treating with levothyroxine which can result in hyperthyroidism (TSH <0.1mIU/L) and symptoms of increased heart rate, diarrhea, tremor, hypercalcemia, and weakness to name a few.[F4636]\r\n\r\nAs many cardiac functions including heart rate, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance are closely linked to thyroid status,[A179938] over-treatment with levothyroxine may result in increases in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients.

This inhibition blocks the vasoconstricting (narrowing) effect of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) on the vessels, leading to peripheral blood vessel dilation.

This reduction in prostanoid production is the common mechanism that mediates the effects of nambutone.\r\n\r\nPGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.\r\n\r\nPGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to \u03b2 adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.\r\n\r\nPGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.\r\n\r\nThe adverse effects of NSAIDs stem from the protective and regulatory roles of prostanoids which have been well-characterized.[T116] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> regulate blood flow to the kidney by similar mechanisms to the vasodilation they produce in inflammation. Prevention of this regulation by NSAIDs produces vasoconstriction which limits renal function by reducing blood flow and the hydrostatic pressure which drives filtration. PGE<sub>2</sub> also regulates gastric protection via EP<sub>3</sub> receptors which are, in this location, coupled to G<sub>i</sub> which inhibits the AC/PKA pathway. This reduces the secretion of protons by H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase in parietal cells and increases the secretion of mucus and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> by superficial endothelial cells. Disruption of this protective action by NSAIDs lead to ulceration of the gastric mucosa. Lastly, disruption of PGI<sub>2</sub>, which opposes platelet aggregation, generation by COX-2 selective agents leads to an imbalance with TXA<sub>2</sub> generated by COX-1, which promotes aggregation of platelets, leading to increased risk of thrombosis. Since nabumetone is somewhat COX-2 selective it is thought to promote this imbalance and increase thrombotic risk.[A178903]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: NSAIDs, like nabumetone, are well established as analgesics. NSAIDs reduce both peripheral and central sensitization of nociceptive neurons due to inflammation which contribute to hyperalgesia and allodynia.[T116,A179023] This sensitization occurs through reducing the action potential threshold in peripheral neurons, reducing the intensity of painful stimuli needed to produce a painful sensation. Centrally, activation of dorsal horn neurons occurs along with increased release of glutamate, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and substance P which increase the transmission of painful stimuli. Coupled with this is an inhibition glycinergic neurons which normally inhibit pain transmission, a phenomenon known as disinhibition. Increased activity ofn-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA) and \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors leads to the establishment of central sensitization, allowing both mild painful and innocuous stimuli to produce action potentials in nociceptive projection neurons. NSAIDs are effective in reducing mild-moderate acute and chronic nociceptive pain, however, the usefulness of NSAIDs in neuropathic pain is limited.\r\n\r\nThe anti-inflammatory effect of NSAIDs is mediated by preventing vasodilation, increases in vascular permeability, and the release of cytokines from endothelial cells.[T116,A179044] These three effects together prevent immunocompetent cells from migrating to the site of injury thereby preventing additional damage and inflammation due to activation of the immune system at the site of damage. PGs also modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation, an activity which is thought to be of importance in arthritic conditions.\r\n\r\nThe anti-pyretic effect of NSAIDs is mediated through preventing increases in temperature by prostaglandins (PGs) via the hypothalamus.[T116] Activation of this process by other inflammatory mediators relies upon subsequent action by PGs, therefore NSAIDs are able to reduce fever due to these mediators as well.\r\n\r\nThe adverse effects of NSAIDs are related to their therapeutic effects.[T116] The same vasodilatory action which occurs in inflammation also serves to regulate blood flow to the kidneys through the afferent renal arteries. NSAIDs are widely known as nephrotoxic agents as the reduction in PGs produces vasoconstriction of these arteries resulting in reduced blood flow to the kidneys and a subsequent decline in renal function. Reductions in mucus and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretion in the stomach increases the risk of ulceration by limiting the protection mediated by PGs.

THC demonstrates its effects through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors, which results in the well-known effects of smoking cannabis such as increased appetite, reduced pain, and changes in emotional and cognitive processes. Due to its evidence as an appetite stimulant and an anti-nauseant, Dronabinol is approved for use in anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS and for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments [FDA Label].\r\n\r\nTetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the two most abundant cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which are pharmacologically active due to their interaction with cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body [A32830]. While both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. If not provided in their activated form (such as through synthetic forms like Dronabinol or [DB00486]), THC and CBD are obtained through conversion from their precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid-A (THCA-A) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), through decarboxylation reactions. This can be achieved through heating, smoking, vaporization, or baking of dried unfertilized female cannabis flowers.\r\n\r\nFrom a pharmacological perspective, Cannabis' diverse receptor profile explains its potential application for such a wide variety of medical conditions. Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon endogenous cannabinoid receptors of the body [A32584]. The endocannabinoid system is widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system (via the Cannabinoid Receptors CB1 and CB2) and plays a role in many physiological processes such as inflammation, cardiovascular function, learning, pain, memory, stress and emotional regulation, and the sleep/wake cycle among many others [A32824]. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous system, and are most abundant in the hippocampus and amygdala, which are the areas of the brain responsible for short-term memory storage and emotional regulation. CB2 receptors are mainly located in the peripheral nervous system and can be found on lymphoid tissue where they are involved in regulation of immune function [A32676].",

In a study of the pharmacodynamics of chronic dronabinol exposure, healthy male subjects (N = 12) received 12 times the maximum dose for anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS of dronabinol capsules in divided doses for 16 days. An initial tachycardia induced by dronabinol was replaced successively by normal sinus rhythm and then bradycardia.

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Duloxetine is a potent inhibitor of neuronal serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and a less potent inhibitor of dopamine reuptake.[A178714] Duloxetine has no significant affinity for dopaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, opioid, glutamate, and GABA receptors.\r\n\r\nAction on the external urinary sphincter is mediated via duloxetine's CNS effects. Increased serotonin and norepinephrine concentrations in Onuf's nucleus leads to increased activation of 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, and \u03b1<sub>1</sub> adrenergic receptors.[A178663,A178666] 5-HT<sub>2</sub> and \u03b1<sub>1</sub> are both G<sub>q</sub> coupled and their activation increases the activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C (IP<sub>3</sub>/PLC) pathway.[T116] This pathway leads to release of intracellular calcium stores, increasing intracellular calcium concentrations, and facilitating neuronal excitability. 5-HT<sub>3</sub> functions as a ligand-gated sodium channel which allows sodium to flow into the neuron when activated. Increased flow of sodium into the neuron contributes to depolarization and activation of voltage gated channels involved in action potential generation. The combined action of these three receptors contributes to increased excitability of the pudendal motor nerve in response to glutamate.\r\n\r\nAlso related to duloxetine's action at the spinal cord is its modulation of pain. Increasing the concentration of serotonin and norepinephrine in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord increases descending inhibition of pain through activation of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, \u03b1<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic, and \u03b1<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors.[A178705] 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, and \u03b1<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic mediate neuronal activation as described above. The activated neuron in this case is the GABAergic inhibitory interneuron which synapses onto the nociceptive projection neuron to inhibit the transmission of painful stimuli to the brain. The 5-HT<sub>1</sub> and \u03b1<sub>2</sub> receptors are G<sub>i</sub>/G<sub>o</sub> coupled and their activation leads to increased potassium current through inward rectifier channels and decreased adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A signaling which contributes to neuronal inhibition.[A178705,T116] These inhibitory receptors are present on the projection neuron itself as well as the dorsal root ganglion which precedes it and serves to directly suppress the transmission of painful stimuli.\r\n\r\nThe mechanisms involved in duloxetine's benefits in depression and anxiety have not been fully elucidated. Dysfunctional serotonin and norepinephrine signaling are thought to be involved and increases in the availability of these neurotransmitters at the synaptic cleft thought to mediate a therapeutic effect.[A178666] It is postulated that the involvement of serotonin and norepinephrine in area responsible for emotional modulation such as the limbic system contributes to the effects in mood disorders specifically but this has yet to be confirmed.\r\n\r\nDuloxetine's hypertensive effect is related to its intended pharmacological effect. Increased availability of norepinephrine leads to activation of adrenergic receptors on the vascular endothelium. Since the action of \u03b1<sub>1</sub> receptors predominates, vasoconstriction results as the G<sub>q</sub> coupled receptor mediates calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to facilitate smooth muscle contraction.[T116]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Duloxetine, through increasing serotonin and norepinephrine concentrations in Onuf's nucleus, enhances glutamatergic activation of the pudendal motor nerve which innervates the external urethral sphinter.[A178663,A178666] This enhanced signaling allows for stronger contraction. Increased contraction of this sphincter increases the pressure needed to produce an incontinence episode in stress urinary incontinence. Duloxetine has been shown to improve Patient Global Impression of Improvement and Incontinence Quality of Life scores.[A178669] It has also been shown to reduce the median incontinence episode frequency at doses of 40 and 80 mg.\r\n\r\nAction at the dorsal horn of the spinal cord allows duloxetine to strengthen the the serotonergic and adrenergic pathways involved in descending inhibition of pain.[A178666,A178705] This results in an increased threshold of activation necessary to transmit painful stimuli to the brain and effective relief of pain, particularly in neuropathic pain. Pain relief has been noted in a variety of painful conditions including diabetic peripheral neuropathy, fibromyalgia, and osteoarthritis using a range of pain assessment surveys.[A178711]\r\n\r\nWhile duloxetine has been shown to be effective in both animal models of mood disorders and in clinical trials for the treatment of these disorders in humans, the broad scope of its pharmacodynamic effects on mood regulation in the brain has yet to be explained.[A178714]\r\n\r\nIncreased blood pressure is a common side effect with duloxetine due to vasoconstriction mediated by the intended increase in norepinephrine signaling.[label,T116]",

CYP2C9 is known to be a minor contributor to the 5-hydroxy metabolite. Another uncharacterized metabolite is known to be excreted in the feces but comprises <5% of the total excreted drug.

            "summary": "Raloxifene is a second generation selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that mediates anti-estrogenic effects on breast and uterine tissues, and estrogenic effects on bone, lipid metabolism, and blood coagulation.[A4979,T28] Exhibiting tissue-specific effects distinct from [estradiol], raloxifene is the first of the benzothiophene group of antiestrogens to be labelled a SERM.[A4977] Available in many countries worldwide, raloxifene was initially approved by the FDA in December, 1997 under the market name Evista\u00ae for the management and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and reduction in risk for invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis or those who are at high risk for invasive breast cancer. However, it has a negligible effect on altering the development and progression of breast cancer itself.[label] The most common causes of osteoporosis include postmenopausal deficiency of estrogen and age-related deterioration in bone homeostasis. Due to the risk of bone fractures that may lead to morbidities and reduced quality of life, the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women with the use of therapeutic agents in addition to concurrent therapies is critical. Due to the decline in estrogen levels in postmenopausal osteoporosis, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), such as estradiol, has been used to ameliorate the condition. However, due to the off-target actions by HRT, newer non-hormonal agents such as raloxifene and [tamoxifen] have been developed to reduce adverse events through selective pharmacological actions on tissue-specific therapeutic targets.[T28]\r\n\r\nThe main effects of raloxifene are to preserve the bone mineral density and decrease the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Compared to estrogen and tamoxifen, raloxifene was not associated with an increased risk of uterine cancer and it does not cause endometrial proliferation.[A716] Although rare, there was an increased risk of venous thromboembolism during clinical trials of postmenopausal women receiving raloxifene. In addition, a clinical study consisting of postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for coronary events showed an increased risk for fatal stroke with raloxifene therapy compared to placebo.[label] It is strongly advised that the risk-benefit ratio is considered before starting raloxifene therapy in women at risk of thromboembolic disease or strokes, such as the prior history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, or cigarette smoking.[label]",
            "indication": "Indication: Indicated for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, as well as prevention and treatment of corticosteroid-induced bone loss.[label]\r\n\r\nIndicated for the reduction in the risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis or postmenopausal women with a high risk for invasive breast cancer.[label]",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that acts as both an estrogen agonist and antagonist via differential effects on the tissue-specific estrogen receptors. Based on the findings of competitive binding assays, raloxifene displays binding affinity that is similar to that of [estradiol][A721], the predominant circulating estrogen.[A178861] Estrogens play variable roles at different tissues in females, including the bone, breasts, uterus and liver, by binding to the steroid nuclear hormone receptors, Estrogen Receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) or Estrogen Receptor beta (ER\u03b2).[A178861] These receptors are normally bound to the Heat Shock Protein 90 (Hsp90) when unbound to the ligand. Ligand binding induces a conformational change in the receptor that promotes dissociation of the receptor from Hsp90, dimerization and translocation into the nucleus. This movement into the nucleus allows the receptor to bind to genomic locations based on sequence recognition of the DNA binding domain, also known as the Estrogen Response Elements (EREs).[A178861] \r\n\r\nIn bones, endogenous estrogens normally modulate multiple DNA response elements, including the gene-encoding transforming growth factor-\u03b23 (TGF-\u03b23), which is a cytokine embedded in the bone matrix.[T28] TGF-\u03b23 plays an important role in bone remodelling[A178756] by working with other cytokines to induce production of osteoblasts, such as IL-6[A720], and attenuate the activity of osetoclasts. Estrogens typically maintain the bone integrity by inhibiting the cytokines that recruit osteoclasts and oppose the bone-resorbing, Ca2+-mobilizing action of parathyroid hormone. In contrast, estrogens promote osteoblast proliferation, augment the production of TGF-\u03b23 and bone morphogenic proteins, and inhibit apoptosis.[T28] Mimicking the action of endogenous estrogen in bone tissues, raloxifene binds to the estrogen receptor to influence gene transcription through interactions with the estrogen response element (ERE) and a distinct DNA target, the raloxifene response element (RRE).[A722] It occupies the same ER ligand binding site as estrogen.[A724] Upon binding, raloxifene induces a conformational change of the receptor, allowing mediation of direct binding to transcriptional elements by accessory proteins. Increased expression of bone matrix proteins, such as alkaline phosphatase, osteonectin, osteocalcin and collagen may be seen.[A722] The agonistic or antagonistic action of raloxifene depends on the extent of recruitment of coactivators and corepressors to estrogen receptor (ER) target gene promotors.[label] In breast tissues, raloxifene acts as an estrogen receptor antagonist to attenuate the estrogen-dependent proliferative effects of epithelial cell expansion. In addition to the antiproliferative effects, raloxifene prevents the production of cytokines and recruitment of macrophages and lymphocytes into tumor mass.[A178921]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Raloxifene belongs to the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) drug class that exhibits estrogenic effects on bone and lipid metabolism while mediating anti-estrogenic effects on uterine endometrium and breast tissues.[A4977] On skeletal tissues, raloxifene stimulates bone-depositing osteoblasts and inhibits bone-resorbing osteoclasts[T28] to augument bone mineral density.[A4977] Raloxifene produces estrogen-like effects on bone, reducing the resorption of bone and increasing bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, thus slowing the rate of bone loss.[label] In three randomized, placebo-controlled trials in Europe, postmenopausal women receiving raloxifene at variable doses of 30 to 150 mg daily demonstrated significant increases in bone mineral density in the lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck and total body compared to placebo.[A4977] In the MORE and RUTH trials, there were fewer incidences of vertebral fractures in postmeopausal women receiving raloxifene compared to placebo.[A4979] In a eight-week study evaluating short-term effects of raloxifene in healthy postmenopausal women, there was a decrease in the bone turnover markers, such as serum alkaline phosphatase level, serum osteocalcin level and urinary calcium excretion.[A4977] \r\n\r\nRaloxifene was shown to inhibit estrogen-dependent proliferation of human breast cancer cells _in vitro_ and development of induced mammary tumors in rats _in vivo_.[A721] In adult female rats, raloxifene produced a greater regression of the mammary gland than [tamoxifen].[A721] The MORE trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial that investigated the long-term effects of the drug therapy in European and American postmenopausal women receiving raloxifene for 40 months.[A719] Additionally, a reduction in the incidence of invasive breast cancer was also demonstrates in the CORE and RUTH trials.[A4979] Study findings demonstrated that compared to placebo, the risk of invasive breast cancer was decreased by 76% among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. There was a decrease in the risk of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer by 90% but there was no increase in the risk of endometrial cancer. Unlike hormone replacement therapy, raloxifene does not mediate proliferative or stimulatory effects on endometrial tissue. Findings from both animal and human studies demonstrated no significant changes in the histologic appearance of the endometrium.[A4977]\r\n\r\nRaloxifene promotes estrogen-like effects on lipid metabolism. In a European trial that evaluated lipid profiles following raloxifene therapy over the 24-month period, there were significant decreases in the serum concentrations of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol over a 24-month period of raloxifene therapy.[A4977] Raloxifene is not associated with causing alterations in the serum levels of HDL cholesterol or triglycerides.[A4977] As the HDL choesterol level is considered a strong inverse predictor of cardiovascular disease in women, the cardioprotective effects of raloxifene were questioned. Due to limited data on the long-term trials, it is not possible to determine whether the small lipid effects produced by raloxifene correlate with a smaller degree of cardioprotective activity compared with hormone replacement therapy.[A4977] ",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: Raloxifene is reported to undergo metabolism in the intestines and liver devoid of cytochrome P450 pathway.[A4977] It is extensively metabolized, where less than 1% of the total dose exists as unchanged compound.[label] It mainly undergoes first-pass metabolism to form glucuronide conjugates, raloxifene-4'-glucuronide (raloxifene-4'-\u03b2-glucuronide), raloxifene-6-glucuronide (raloxifene-6-\u03b2-glucuronide), and raloxifene-6,4'-diglucuronide. No other metabolites have been detected in human plasma. The terminal log-linear portions of the plasma concentration curves for raloxifene and the glucuronides are generally parallel. This is consistent with interconversion of raloxifene and the glucuronide metabolites.[label]"

Because it is oxidately stable, brimonidine is associated with fewer reports of ocular allergic reactions compared to other alpha-2 adrenergic agonists.[A178969] The ophthalmic solution of brimonidine was first approved by the FDA in 1996 as Alphagan [label] and brimonidine is the only selective alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist approved for chronic treatment in glaucoma.[A36674] Brimonidine is also found in ophthalmic solutions in combination with [brinzolamide] under the market name Simbrinza for the reduction in intraocular pressure. Unlike nonselective beta-blockers used in ocular hypertension, brimonidine is not associated with significantly adverse cardiopulmonary side effects.[A178945] Thus brimonidine is an effective and safe alternative to beta-blockers, in patients with, or at high risk for, cardiopulmonary disease.[A178948] The topical form of brimonidine was approved by the FDA in August 2013 for the symptomatic treatment of persistent facial erythema of rosacea in adults. It is marketed under the brand name Mirvaso.[L6535] Brimonidine is the first topical treatment approved for facial erythema of rosacea.[A178978]",
            "indication": "Indication: **Opthalmic**\r\n\r\nIndicated for lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension [label] as monotherapy or combination product with [brinzolamide].\r\n\r\n**Topical**\r\n\r\nIndicated for the treatment of persistent (non-transient) facial erythema of rosacea in adults 18 years of age or older.[L6535]",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: In the eye, alpha-1 adrenoceptors play a role in vasoconstriction, mydriasis, eyelid retraction, and elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) whereas alpha-2 adrenoceptors are responsible for IOP reduction via a complex Gi-coupled signaling cascade pathway. Activation of alpha-2 receptors leads to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and reduction of cyclic AMP levels. As a result, there is a decrease in norpinephrine (NE) release at the synaptic junction, NE-induced stimulation of beta-2 adrenoceptors, and production of aqueous humor by the ciliary epithelium.[A178969] An elevated IOP is the most significant risk factor for developing glaucomatous optic neuropathy, which is associated with progressive visual field loss and functional disability if left untreated.[A179002] Regardless of the etiology of the disease, the aim of current therapies for glaucoma is to reduce IOP, as reduction of IOP significantly reduces the risk of progression of vision loss even when IOP is already within the normal range.[A36674] When administered ophthalmically, brimonidine is rapidly absorbed into the eye, acts as an agonist at ocular alpha-2 adrenoceptors and lowers IOP via a dual mechanism of action.[A178981] It is proposed that initial dosing of the drug causes a reduction in aqueous humour production and chronic dosing leads to an increase in uveoscleral outflow.[A179002] Brimonidine does not affect episcleral venous pressure.[A178969] By reducing IOP, brimonidine aims to reduce the likelihood of glaucomatous visual field loss in ocular hypertension, and slow the progression of visual field defect in established open-angle glaucoma.[A178951] When applied topically on skin, brimonidine reduces erythema through direct vasocontriction of small arteries and veins.[A178978] As brimonidine mediates a potent peripheral vasoconstrictive activity by selectively working on the alpha-2 adrenoceptors, the use of brimonidine is thought to be efficacious for the treatment of facial erythema of rosacea, which is thought to arise from vasomotor instability and abnormal vasodilation of the superficial cutaneous vasculature of the face.[A178984]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Brimonidine is a highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist that is 1000-fold more selective for the alpha2-adrenergic receptor than the alpha1-adrenergic receptor.[L6544] This characteristic gives the drug some therapeutic advantages, since it reduces the risk of systemic side effects, such as systemic hypotension, bradycardia, and sedation. In addition, there is a reduction in the risk for developing alpha-1 mediated ocular unwanted effects, such as conjunctival blanching, mydriasis, and eyelid retraction.[A179002] However, despite high alpha-2 receptor specificity, brimonidine may still produce alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediated ocular effects, such as conjunctival vasoconstriction.[A178969] Brimonidine has a peak ocular hypotensive effect occurring at two hours post-dosing.[label] In a randomized, double-blind clinical study, ocular administration of 0.2% brimonidine in healthy volunteers resulted in a 23% reduction of mean intraocular pressure from baseline at 3 hours following administration.[A178951] In comparative studies consisting of patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, the ocular hypotensive effect of brimonidine was maintained during treatment periods of up to 1 year.[A178945] \r\n\r\nBrimonidine mediates vasoconstrictive effects and it was shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties in _ex vivo_ human skin model and _in vivo_ inflammation models.[A179041] In a clinial trials consisting of adults with moderate to severe facial erythema of rosacea, brimonidine was shown to improve the extent of redness at 3 hours after application, compared to placebo.[L6544] It was shown to be a potent vasoconstrictor of human subcutaneous vessels with a diameter of less than 200 \u00b5m. In _in vivo_ mouse inflammation models, brimonidine displayed anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting edema.[A178978] In a randomized, double-blind study, brimonidine reduced erythema for the 12 hours of the study in a dose-dependent manner.[A178978]\r\n\r\nWhen adminsitered systemically, brimonidine was shown to cause cardiovascular effects by decreasing blood pressure, decreasing heart and respiratory rate, and prolonging the PR interval in the electrocardiogram. This is due to the targeting of adrenoceptors by the drug.[A178963,A178966] Although the clinical significance has not been established, there is evidence that brimonidine exhibits neuroprotective activity in experimental models of cerebral ischemia and optic nerve injury.[A178969] _In vitro_ studies show that brimonidine mediated protective effects on neuronal cells from kainate acid insult and on cultured retinal ganglion cells from glutamate-induced cytotoxicity, which is a possible mediator of secondary neuronal degeneration in human glaucoma. Neuroprotective actions of brimonidine were also demonstrated in rat models of acute retinal ischemia and chronic IOP elevation. It has been proposed that brimonidine may exert neuroprotective effects on the retina and optic nerve by enhancing intrinsic retinal ganglion cell survival mechanisms and/or induction of neuronal survival factors, such as bFGF.[A178951] However, further investigations are needed to conclude on these possible therapeutic benefits of the drug.",

Although structurally distinct from THC, nabilone mimics THC's structure and pharmacological activity through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors, however it is considered to be twice as active as \u0394\u2079-THC. Nabilone is approved by the FDA for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments [FDA Label].\r\n\r\nTetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the two most abundant cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which are pharmacologically active due to their interaction with cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body [A32830]. While both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. If not provided in their activated form (such as through synthetic forms like Nabilone or [DB00470]), THC and CBD are obtained through conversion from their precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid-A (THCA-A) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), through decarboxylation reactions. This can be achieved through heating, smoking, vaporization, or baking of dried unfertilized female cannabis flowers.\r\n\r\nFrom a pharmacological perspective, Cannabis' diverse receptor profile explains its potential application for such a wide variety of medical conditions. Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon endogenous cannabinoid receptors of the body [A32584]. The endocannabinoid system is widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system (via the Cannabinoid Receptors CB1 and CB2) and plays a role in many physiological processes such as inflammation, cardiovascular function, learning, pain, memory, stress and emotional regulation, and the sleep/wake cycle among many others [A32824]. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous system, and are most abundant in the hippocampus and amygdala, which are the areas of the brain responsible for short-term memory storage and emotional regulation. CB2 receptors are mainly located in the peripheral nervous system and can be found on lymphoid tissue where they are involved in regulation of immune function [A32676].\r\n\r\nIn Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Mexico, nabilone is marketed as Cesamet.

            "summary": "Buspirone is a novel anxiolytic agent with a unique structure and a pharmacological profile. Belonging to the azaspirodecanedione drug class,[A180991] buspirone is a serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor agonist that is not chemically or pharmacologically related to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and other sedative/anxiolytic drugs.[L4478] Unlike many drugs used to treat anxiety, buspirone does not exhibit anticonvulsant, sedative, hypnotic, and muscle-relaxant properties. Due to these characteristics, buspirone been termed 'anxioselective'.[A180985] First synthesized in 1968 then patented in 1975,[L7375] it is commonly marketed under the brand name Buspar\u00ae. Buspirone was first approved in 1986 by the FDA [A181751] and has been used to treat anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and relieve symptoms of anxiety. It has also been used as a second-line therapy for unipolar depression when the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is deemed clinically inadequate or inappropriate.[L7375] The potential use of buspirone in combination with [melatonin] in depression and cognitive impairment via promoting neurogenesis has also been investigated.[A181751]",
            "indication": "Indication: Indicated for the management of anxiety disorders or the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety.[L4478]",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: The therapeutic action of buspirone in generalized anxiety disorders is thought to be mainly derived from its interaction with two major 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor subtypes that are involved in the brain's anxiety and fear circuitry to enhance the serotonergic activity in these brain areas.[L7375] Buspirone acts as a full agonist at presynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors, or 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors, expressed at dorsal raphe while acting as a partial agonist at the postsynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors expressed on hippocampus and cortex.[A182315,A182420] 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors function as inhibitory autoreceptors by being expressed on the soma or dendrites of serotonergic neurons or mediate postsynaptic actions of 5-HT by being highly expressed on the corticolimbic circuits.[T28] They are inhibitory G-protein coupled receptors that couple to Gi/Go proteins. When activated, presynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors causes neuron hyperpolarization and reduces the firing rate of the serotonergic neuron, thereby decreasing extracellular 5-HT levels in the neuron's projection areas. Activated postsynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors promote hyperpolarization to released 5-HT on pyramidal neurons.[A182420] \r\n\r\nThe anxiolytic action of buspirone is mainly thought to arise from the interaction at presynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors. Acting as a potent agonist in these receptors, buspirone initially causes activation of these autoreceptors and inhibition of 5-HT release. It is proposed that buspirone induces desensitization of somatodendritic autoreceptors over time, which may explain the delayed onset of action of the drug. Desensitization of the autoreceptors ultimately results in heightened excitation of serotonergic neurons and enhanced 5-HT release.[T28] Buspirone also displays a weak affinity for serotonin 5HT2 receptors and acts as a weak antagonist on dopamine D2 autoreceptors,[L7375] although there is not much evidence that the action at these receptors contribute to the anxiolytic effect of buspirone.[A182312] It acts as an antagonist at presynaptic dopamine D3 and D4 receptors and may bind to alpha-1 adrenergic receptors as a partial agonist.[A181751]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: The clinical effect of buspirone in alleviating the symptoms of generalized anxiety disorders typically takes 2 to 4 weeks to achieve.[L7375] The delayed onset of action of buspirone suggests that the therapeutic effectiveness in generalized anxiety may involved more than its molecular mechanism of action at the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors,[T28] or buspirone may induce adaptations of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors.[L7375] Buspirone was not shown to alter the psychomotor or cognitive function in healthy volunteers, and the risk of developing sedation is relatively low compared to other anxiolytics, such as benzodiazepines.[A180985] Unlike benzodiazepines and barbiturates used in anxiety disorders, buspirone is not associated with a risk for developing physical dependence or withdrawal, or any significant interaction with central nervous system depressants such as ethanol. This is due to the lack of effects on GABA receptors.[A180985,L7375] Buspirone also does not exhibit any anticonvulsant or muscle-relaxing properties,[A182309] but may interfere with arousal reactions due to its inhibitory action on the aactivity of noradrenergic locus coerulus neurons.[T28]\r\n\r\nDespite its clinical effectiveness in generalized anxiety, buspirone demonstrated limited clinical effectiveness on panic disorders, severe anxiety, phobias, and obsessive compulsive disorders.[A181751,T28] The clinical effectiveness of the long-term use of buspirone, for more than 3 to 4 weeks, has not demonstrated in controlled trials but there were no observable significant adverse events in patients receiving buspirone for a year in a study of long-term use.[L4478]",

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: There are two isoforms of ACE: the somatic isoform, which exists as a glycoprotein comprised of a single polypeptide chain of 1277; and the testicular isoform, which has a lower molecular mass and is thought to play a role in sperm maturation and binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelium. Somatic ACE has two functionally active domains, N and C, which arise from tandem gene duplication. Although the two domains have high sequence similarity, they play distinct physiological roles. The C-domain is predominantly involved in blood pressure regulation while the N-domain plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. ACE inhibitors bind to and inhibit the activity of both domains, but have much greater affinity for and inhibitory activity against the C-domain. Fosinoprilat, the active metabolite of fosinopril, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII. Decreasing ATII levels in the body decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the pressor effects of ATII as described in the Pharmacology section above. Fosinoprilat also causes an increase in plasma renin activity likely due to a loss of feedback inhibition mediated by ATII on the release of renin and/or stimulation of reflex mechanisms via baroreceptors. ",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Following oral administration, fosinopril is rapidly and completely hydrolyzed to its principle active metabolite, fosinoprilat. Hydrolysis is thought to occur in the gastrointestinal mucosa and liver. Fosinoprilat is a competitive inhibitor of ACE, a peptidyl dipeptidase that is part of the RAAS. The RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from the granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. In the blood stream, renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to ATI, which is subsequently cleaved to ATII by ACE. ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. First, it stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone travels to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting tubule of nephrons where it increases sodium and water reabsorption by increasing the number of sodium channels and sodium-potassium ATPases on cell membranes. Second, ATII stimulates the secretion of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. Third, ATII increases blood pressure through direct arterial vasoconstriction. Stimulation of the Type 1 ATII receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells leads to a cascade of events resulting in myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. In addition to these major effects, ATII induces the thirst response via stimulation of hypothalamic neurons. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. ACE (also known as kininase II) is also involved in the enzymatic deactivation of bradykinin, a vasodilator. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may further sustain the effects of fosinoprilat by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure. ",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: Since fosinoprilat is not biotransformed after intravenous administration, fosinopril, not fosinoprilat, appears to be the precursor for the glucuronide and p-hydroxy metabolites."

In mammals, COMT is distributed throughout various organs with the highest activities in the liver and kidney. COMT also occurs in the heart, lung, smooth and skeletal muscles, intestinal tract, reproductive organs, various glands, adipose tissue, skin, blood cells and neuronal tissues, especially in glial cells. COMT catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group of S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the phenolic group of substrates that contain a catechol structure. Physiological substrates of COMT include dopa, catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine) and their hydroxylated metabolites. The function of COMT is the elimination of biologically active catechols and some other hydroxylated metabolites. COMT is responsible for the elimination of biologically active catechols and some other hydroxylated metabolites. In the presence of a decarboxylase inhibitor, COMT becomes the major metabolizing enzyme for levodopa, catalyzing the it to 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-L-phenylalanine (3-OMD) in the brain and periphery.",

Haloperidol is indicated for the treatment of the manifestations of several psychotic disorders including schizophrenia, acute psychosis, Tourette syndrome, and other severe behavioural states.[F4645] It is also used off-label for the management of chorea associated with Huntington's disease and for the treatment of intractable hiccups as it is a potent antiemetic. Dopamine-antagonizing medications such as haloperidol are though to improve psychotic symptoms and states that are caused by an over-production of dopamine, such as schizophrenia, which is theorized to be caused by a hyperdopaminergic state within the limbic system of the brain.[A34360]\r\n\r\nUse of the first-generation antipsychotics (including haloperidol) is considered highly effective for the management of the \"positive\" symptoms of schizophrenia including hallucinations, hearing voices, aggression/hostility, disorganized speech, and psychomotor agitation. However, this class of drugs is also limited by the development of movement disorders induced by dopamine-blockade such as drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, tardive dyskinesia, as well as other side effects including sedation, weight gain, and prolactin changes. While there are limited high-quality studies comparing haloperidol to lower-potency first-generation antipsychotics such as [DB00477], [DB01624], [DB00623], and [DB01403], haloperidol typically demonstrates the least amount of side effects within this class, but demonstrates a stronger disposition for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).[A180613, A180616, A180625] These other low\u2010potency antipsychotics are limited by their lower affinity for dopamine receptors, which requires a higher dose to effectively treat symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, they block many receptors other than the primary target (dopamine receptors), such as cholinergic or histaminergic receptors, resulting in a higher incidence of side effects such as sedation, weight gain, and hypotension.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, in vivo pharmacogenetic studies have demonstrated that the metabolism of haloperidol may be modulated by genetically determined polymorphic _CYP2D6_ activity.

However, haloperidol use remains widespread and is considered the benchmark for comparison in trials of the newer generation antipsychotics.[A180625]\r\n\r\nThe efficacy of haloperidol was first established in controlled trials in the 1960s.[A180610]",

Haloperidol is also indicated in the short-term treatment of hyperactive children who show excessive motor activity with accompanying conduct disorders consisting of some or all of the following symptoms: impulsivity, difficulty sustaining attention, aggressivity, mood lability, and poor frustration tolerance.

The optimal clinical efficacy of antipsychotics is associated with the blockade of approximately 60 % - 80 % of D2 receptors in the brain.[A34360]\r\n\r\nWhile the exact mechanism is not entirely understood, haloperidol is known to inhibit the effects of dopamine and increase its turnover. Traditional antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, bind more tightly than dopamine itself to the dopamine D2 receptor, with dissociation constants that are lower than that for dopamine.[A4962] It is believed that haloperidol competitively blocks post-synaptic dopamine (D2) receptors in the brain, eliminating dopamine neurotransmission and leading to the relief of delusions and hallucinations that are commonly associated with psychosis. It acts primarily on the D2-receptors and has some effect on 5-HT2 and \u03b11-receptors, with negligible effects on dopamine  D1-receptors. The drug also exerts some blockade of \u03b1-adrenergic receptors of the autonomic system.[L2022]\r\n\r\nAntagonistic activity regulated through dopamine D2 receptors in the chemoreceptive trigger zone (CTZ) of the brain renders its antiemetic activity. Of the three D2-like receptors, only the D2 receptor is blocked by antipsychotic drugs in direct relation to their clinical antipsychotic abilities. \r\n\r\nClinical brain-imaging findings show that haloperidol remains tightly bound to D2 dopamine receptors in humans undergoing 2 positron emission tomography (PET) scans with a 24h pause in between scans.[A4962] A common adverse effect of this drug is the development of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), due to this tight binding of haloperidol to the dopamine D2 receptor.\r\n\r\nDue to the risk of unpleasant and sometimes lifelong extrapyramidal symptoms, newer antipsychotic medications than haloperidol have been discovered and formulated. Rapid dissociation of drugs from dopamine D2 receptors is a plausible explanation for the improved EPS profile of atypical antipsychotics such as [DB00734]. This is also consistent with the theory of a lower affinity for D2 receptors for these drugs.  As mentioned above, haloperidol binds tightly to the dopamine receptor, potentiating the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms,[A4962] and therefore should only been used when necessary.",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Use of the first-generation antipsychotics (including haloperidol) is considered highly effective for the management of the \"positive\" symptoms of schizophrenia including hallucinations, hearing voices, aggression/hostility, disorganized speech, and psychomotor agitation. However, this class is limited by the development of movement disorders such as drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, and tardive dyskinesia, and other side effects including sedation, weight gain, and prolactin changes. Compared to the lower-potency first-generation antipsychotics such as [DB00477], [DB01624], [DB00623], and [DB01403], haloperidol typically demonstrates the least amount of side effects within class, but demonstrates a stronger disposition for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).[A180613, A180616, A180625] Low\u2010potency medications have a lower affinity for dopamine receptors so that a higher dose is required to effectively treat symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, they block many receptors other than the primary target (dopamine receptors), such as cholinergic or histaminergic receptors, resulting in a higher incidence of side effects such as sedation, weight gain, and hypotension.\r\n\r\nThe balance between the wanted drug effects on psychotic symptoms and unwanted side effects are largely at play within dopaminergic brain pathways affected by haloperidol. Cortical dopamine-D2-pathways play an important role in regulating these effects and include the nigrostriatal pathway, which is responsible for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways, which are responsible for the improvement in positive schizophrenic symptoms, and the tuberoinfundibular dopamine pathway, which is responsible for hyperprolactinemia. \r\n\r\nA syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome.[F4645]\r\n\r\nCases of sudden death, QT-prolongation, and Torsades de Pointes have been reported in patients receiving haloperidol. Higher than recommended doses of any formulation and intravenous administration of haloperidol appear to be associated with a higher risk of QT-prolongation and Torsades de Pointes. Although cases have been reported even in the absence of predisposing factors, particular caution is advised in treating patients with other QT-prolonging conditions (including electrolyte imbalance [particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia], drugs known to prolong QT, underlying cardiac abnormalities, hypothyroidism, and familial long QT-syndrome).[F4645]\r\n\r\nA potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status (including catatonic signs) and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure.[F4645]",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: Haloperidol is extensively metabolised in the liver with only about 1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in urine.[A32346] \r\n\r\nIn humans, haloperidol is biotransformed to various metabolites, including p-fluorobenzoylpropionic acid, 4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidine, reduced haloperidol, pyridinium metabolites, and haloperidol glucuronide. In psychiatric patients treated regularly with haloperidol, the concentration of haloperidol glucuronide in plasma is the highest among the metabolites, followed, in rank order, by unchanged haloperidol, reduced haloperidol and reduced haloperidol glucuronide.\r\n\r\nThe drug is thought to be metabolized primarily by oxidative N-dealkylation of the piperidine nitrogen to form fluorophenylcarbonic acids and piperidine metabolites (which appear to be inactive), and by reduction of the butyrophenone carbonyl to the carbinol, forming _hydroxyhaloperidol_.\r\n\r\nThe enzymes involved in the biotransformation of haloperidol include cytochrome P450 (CYP) including CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, carbonyl reductase and uridine di-phosphoglucose glucuronosyltransferase enzymes. The greatest proportion of the intrinsic hepatic clearance of haloperidol is performed by glucuronidation and followed by the reduction of haloperidol to reduced haloperidol and by CYP-mediated oxidation. \r\n\r\nIn studies of cytochrome-mediated disposition in vitro, CYP3A4 appears to be the major isoform of the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of haloperidol in humans. The intrinsic clearance of the back-oxidation of reduced haloperidol to the parent compound, oxidative N-dealkylation and pyridinium formation are of the same order of magnitude. This suggests that the same enzyme system is responsible for the above three metabolic reactions.\r\n\r\nIn vivo human studies on haloperidol metabolism have shown that the glucuronidation of haloperidol accounts for 50 to 60% of haloperidol biotransformation and that approximately 23% of the biotransformation was accounted for by the reduction pathway. The remaining 20 to 30% ofthe biotransformation of haloperidol would be via N-dealkylation and pyridinium formation.[A32346] "

The *pol*-encoded proteins are initially translated in the form of a larger precursoe polypeptide, *gag-pol*, and needs to be cleaved by HIV protease to form other complement proteins [A19647]. Ritonavir prevents the cleavage of the *gag-pol* polyprotein, which results in noninfectious, immature viral particles. Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 isoenzyme present both in the intestinal tract and liver [A19647]. It is a type II ligand that perfectly fits into the CYP3A4 active site cavity and irreversibly binds to the heme iron via the thiazole nitrogen, which decreases the redox potential of the protein and precludes its reduction with the redox partner, cytochrome P450 reductase [A19648].

In parasitic-protozoa, Nitazoxanide also induces lesions in the cell membranes and depolarizes the mitochondrial membrane while inhibiting quinone oxidoreductase NQO1, nitroreductase-1 and protein disulphide isomerase enzymes. In addition, this drug also inhibits the glutathione-S-transferase (a major detoxifying enzyme) and modulates the Avr-14 gene, encoding for the alpha-type subunit of glutamate-gated chloride ion channel present in nematodes. Aside from its well understood non-competitive inhibition of the PFOR in anaerobic bacteria, NTZ also demonstrates various other antibacterial mechanisms. It inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase in E Coli, disrupts the membrane potential and pH homeostasis in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis, suppresses the chaperone/usher (CU) pathway of the gram-negative bacteria,  and stimulates host macrophage autophagy in tuberculosis patients [A31976]. NTZ also suppresses viral replication by inhibiting the maturation of the viral hemagglutinin and the viral transcription factor immediate early 2 (IE2) as well as by activating the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 (an antiviral intracellular protein).

The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload.",

As this is necessary in DNA replication, the cells can no longer divide. In addition, these drugs add methyl or other alkyl groups onto molecules where they do not belong which in turn inhibits their correct utilization by base pairing and causes a miscoding of DNA.

            "summary": "Fondaparinux (Arixtra) is a synthetic anticoagulant agent consisting of five monomeric sugar units and a O-methyl group at the reducing end of the molecule. It is structurally similar to polymeric glycosaminoglycan heparin and heparan sulfate (HS) when they are cleaved into monomeric units. The monomeric sequence in heparin and HS is thought to form the high affinity binding site for the natural anti-coagulant factor, antithrombin III (ATIII). Once bound to heparin or HS, the anticoagulant activity of ATIII is potentiated by 1000-fold. Fondaparinux potentiates the neutralizing action of ATIII on activated Factor X 300-fold. Fondaparinux may be used: to prevent venous thromboembolism in patients who have undergone orthopedic surgery of the lower limbs (e.g. hip fracture, hip replacement and knee surgery); to prevent VTE in patients undergoing abdominal surgery who are are at high risk of thromboembolic complications; in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pumonary embolism (PE); in the management of unstable angina (UA) and non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI); and in the management of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).",

Fondaparinux should not be used as the sole anticoagulant during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to an increased risk of guiding catheter thrombosis. ",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: The antithrombotic activity of fondaparinux is the result of ATIII-mediated selective inhibition of Factor Xa. By selectively binding to ATIII, Fondaparinux potentiates (about 300 times) the neutralization of Factor Xa by ATIII. Neutralization of Factor Xa interrupts the blood coagulation cascade and thus inhibits thrombin formation and thrombus development. It is thought that fondaparinux is unlikely to induce thrombocytopenia via a heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)-like mechanism given its chemical structure [A17488]. As a result, fondaparinux has been used as an alternative anticoagulant in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) patients [A33876,A33877,A33878]. However, it is important to note that rare cases of HIT have been reported in patients treated with fondaparinux [A33879,A33880].",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Fondaparinux binds specifically to the natural anticoagulant factor, ATIII. Binding to ATIII potentiates the neutralizing action of ATIII on Factor Xa 300-times. Neutralization of Factor Xa decreases the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, which subsequently decreases the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin (loose meshwork). The decrease in thrombin also decreases the activation of Factor XIII, which decreases the conversion of fibrin in its loose meshwork form to its stabilized meshwork form. Disruption of the coagulation cascade effectively decreases the formation of blood clots. Fondaparinux does not inactivate thrombin (activated Factor II). According to the manufacturer, fondaparinux has no known effect on platelet function. In studies comparing fondaparinux to enoxaparin, decreases in platelet levels were observed in similar numbers of patients from both groups (2-5%) [A871,A872]. At the recommended dose, Fondaparinux does not affect fibrinolytic activity or bleeding time. There is no antidote for fondaparinux. Monitoring of the anticoagulant activity of fondaparinux is not generally required. The anti-factor Xa assay may be used to monitor therapy in special populations such as those with renal impairment or who are pregnant. Complete blood count (CBC) and kidney function should be monitored during treatment. ",

Also, it acts in less innervated smooth muscle that responds to endogenous acetylcholine.[A251670,L42815] The actions of atropine can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites (for instance, the use of anticholinesterase agents that inhibit the hydrolysis of acetylcholine).[L42835]",

Compared to [scopolamine], atropine has a more potent and prolonged effect on the heart, intestine and bronchial muscle, but a weaker effect on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands. Atropine leads to increased respiratory rate and depth of respiration, possibly due to the drug-induced bronchiolar dilatation rather than its mild effect on vagal excitation.[L42835]\r\n\r\nAt an adequate dose, atropine abolishes different types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. Atropine can be used to prevent or abolish bradycardia or asystole induced by the injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus.[L42835] When vagal activity is an etiologic factor, atropine may also lessen the degree of partial heart block. In clinical doses, atropine counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure.[L42835] The use of topical atropine in the eye induces mydriasis by inhibiting the contraction of the circular pupillary sphincter muscle normally stimulated by acetylcholine. This results in the contraction of the countering radial pupillary dilator muscle and pupil dilation.[L42830]\r\n\r\nThe use of atropine may precipitate acute glaucoma and convert partial organic pyloric stenosis into complete obstruction.

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Lactulose is a synthetic disaccharide derivative of lactose that consists of one molecule of galactose and one molecule of fructose.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] Saccharolytic bacteria present in the large intestine subsequently break the substance down into organic acids like lactic acid and small amounts of formic and acetic acids.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] Such resultant volatile fatty acid metabolites, in combination with hydrogen and methane that is also generated consequently enhance intraluminal gas formation, peristaltic gut motility, and elicit an osmotic effect that facilitates an increase in the water content of stool as well as associated stool softening.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] All of these actions ultimately assist in facilitating and increasing the frequency of bowel movements in patients experiencing constipation, although it may take 24 to 48 hours after using the medication for this laxative effect to become evident.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the formation of such acids via the metabolism of lactulose by colonic bacteria also acidifies the contents of the colon, thereby contributing to the treatment of portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE).[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] As one of the principal features of PSE involves the accumulation of nitrogenous waste products like ammonia in the systemic circulation, a state in which the colonic contents become more acidic than blood allows ammonia in the circulation to diffuse into the colon.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]. Furthermore, ammonia that diffuses into the acidic colon is ionized to ammonium ions that are incapable of being absorbed back into the blood.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] These effects, combined with the laxative action of lactulose facilitates the excretion of excess ammonia.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] And finally, it is also believed that an acidic colonic environment results in the elimination of urease-producing bacteria that contribute to the formation of ammonia while surviving colonic bacteria use up any trapped ammonia in the colon as a source of nitrogen for protein synthesis.[L6202]",

Enalapril is an orally-active and long-acting nonsulphydryl antihypertensive agent that suppresses the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to lower blood pressure. It was developed from a targeted research programmed using molecular modelling.[A18459] Being a prodrug, enalapril is rapidly biotransformed into its active metabolite, [enalaprilat], which is responsible for the pharmacological actions of enalapril.

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a signaling pathway that works in synergism with the sympathetic system to regulate blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. Activation of this system upon stimulation by different factors, such as low blood pressure and nerve impulses, leads to increased release of norepinephrine (NE) from sympathetic nerve terminals and effects on the vascular growth, vasoconstriction, and salt retention in the kidneys.[T28] Renin is released from \r\nRenin acts on the precursor prottein angiotensinogen, which is a plasma globulin synthesized from the liver, to produce cleaved peptide hormone angiotensin I.[T28] Angiotensin I then can be further cleaved by ACE to produce angiotensin II, a vasoconstrictive peptide hormone.[label] Present in different isoforms, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is peptidyl dipeptidase enzyme expressed in various tissues, including the vascular tissues, such as the heart, brain, and kidneys.[T28] ACE also plays a role in inactivation of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide.[T28,label] Angiotensin II mediates various actions on the body by working on its G-protein coupled receptors, AT1 and AT2.[T28] It causes direct vasoconstriction of precapillary arterioles and postcapillary venules, inhibits the reuptake of NE thereby increasing available levels, stimulates the release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla, reduces urinary excretion of sodium ions and water by promoting proximal tubular reabsorption, stimulates synthesis and release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, and stimulates hypertrophy of both vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac myocytes.[L6619]\r\n\r\nEnalapril is a pharmacologically inactive prodrug that requires hepatic biotransformation to form [enalaprilat], its active metabolite that works on the RAAS to inhibit ACE.[label] Biotransformation is critial for the therapeutic actions of the drug, as enalapril itself is only a weak inhibitor of ACE.[A179131] ACE inhibition results in reduced production and plasma levels of angiotensin II, increased plasma renin activity due to the loss of feedback inhibition by angiotensin II, and decreased aldosterone secretion.[L6586] However, plasma aldosterone levels usually return to normal during long-term administration of enalapril.[A179140] Decreased levels of angiotensin II subsequently leads to the dilatation of peripheral vessles and reduced vascular resistance which in turn lower blood pressure.[A179140] While inhibition of ACE leading to suppression of RAAS is thought to be the primary mechanism of action of enalapril, the drug was shown to still exert antihypertensive effects on individuals with low-renin hypertension. It is suggested that enalapril may mediate its pharmacological actions via other modes of action that are not fully understood.[label] As ACE is structurally similar to kininase I, which is a carboxypeptidase that degrades bradykinin, whether increased levels of bradykinin play a role in the therapeutic effects of enalapril remains to be elucidated.[label]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Enalapril is an antihypertensive agent that exhibits natriuretic and uricosuric properties. Enalapril lowers blood pressure in all grades of essential and renovascular hypertension, and peripheral vascular resistance without causing an increase in heart rate.[A179137] Individuals with low-renin hypertensive population were still responsive to enalapril.[label] The duration of hypertensive effect in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure persists for at least 24 hours following initial administration of a single oral dose, and repeated daily administration of enalapril confers an additional reduction in blood pressure and a steady-state antihypertensive response may take several weeks.[A179140] In patients with severe congestive heart failure and inadequate clinical response to conventional antihypertensive therapies, treatment with enalapril resulted in improvements in cardiac performance as observed by a reduction in both preload and afterload, and improved clinical status long-term.[A179137] Furthermore, enalapril was shown to increase cardiac output and stroke volume while decreasing pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in patients with congestive heart failure refractory to conventional treatment with digitalis and diuretics. In clinical studies, enalapril reduced left ventricular mass, and did not affect cardiac function or myocardial perfusion during exercise.[A179134] Enalapril is not highly associated with the risk of bradycardia unlike most diuretics and beta-blockers [A179137] and it does not produce rebound hypertension upon discontinuation of therapy.[A179134] \r\n\r\nEnalapril is not reported to produce hypokalaemia, hyperglycaemia, hyperuricaemia or hypercholesterolaemia.

Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.\r\n\r\nPGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to \u03b2 adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.\r\n\r\nPGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever.

Applied topically, it may be used in the treatment of head lice infestation.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic, ivermectin began garnering notoriety due to its off-label use for the prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19. While studies are still ongoing, much of the evidence for ivermectin in COVID-19 relies on pre-print _in vitro_ data, and the clinical utility of this data remains unclear. Due to a number of factors - for example, the relatively low number of patients per trial and the speed at which these trials were conducted - studies on the use of ivermectin in COVID-19 have been fraught with statistical errors and accusations of plagiarism.[L36763,A238929] In addition, the use of aggregate patient data in large-scale meta-analyses (as opposed to individual patient data (IPD)) has been shown to disguise otherwise blatant data errors, such as extreme terminal digit bias and the duplication of blocks of patient records.[A238929]  \r\n\r\nUntil high-quality, peer-reviewed data regarding both the safety and efficacy of ivermectin for COVID-19 in humans becomes available, the use of ivermectin for these purposes should be avoided in favour of thoroughly-vetted therapies (e.g. COVID-19 vaccines like [Comirnaty](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB15696)).",

Antiviral activity of efavirenz is dependent on intracellular conversion to the active triphosphorylated form. The rate of efavirenz phosphorylation varies, depending on cell type. It is believed that inhibition of reverse transcriptase interferes with the generation of DNA copies of viral RNA, which, in turn, are necessary for synthesis of new virions. Intracellular enzymes subsequently eliminate the HIV particle that previously had been uncoated, and left unprotected, during entry into the host cell. Thus, reverse transcriptase inhibitors are virustatic and do not eliminate HIV from the body.

            "summary": "Simvastatin, also known as the brand name product Zocor, is a lipid-lowering drug derived synthetically from a fermentation product of _Aspergillus terreus_. It belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage abnormal lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as \"bad cholesterol\"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]\r\n\r\nSimvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]\r\n\r\nWhile all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, while simvastatin has been found to have an average decrease in LDL-C of ~35%.[A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Potency is thought to correlate to tissue permeability as the more lipophilic statins such as simvastatin are thought to enter endothelial cells by passive diffusion, as opposed to hydrophilic statins such as [pravastatin] and [rosuvastatin] which are taken up into hepatocytes through OATP1B1 (organic anion transporter protein 1B1)-mediated transport.[A181424,A181460] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181427]",
            "indication": "Indication: Simvastatin is indicated for the treatment of hyperlipidemia to reduce elevated total cholesterol (total-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL\u2011C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and triglycerides (TG), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C).[F4655, F4658]\r\n\r\nThis includes the treatment of primary hyperlipidemia (Fredrickson type IIa, heterozygous familial and nonfamilial), mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson type IIb), hypertriglyceridemia (Fredrickson type IV hyperlipidemia), primary dysbetalipoproteinemia (Fredrickson type III hyperlipidemia), homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments, as well as adolescent patients with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HeFH).[F4655, F4658]\r\n\r\nSimvastatin is also indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality including myocardial infarction, stroke, and the need for revascularization procedures. It is primarily used in patients at high risk of coronary events because of existing coronary heart disease, diabetes, peripheral vessel disease, history of stroke or other cerebrovascular disease.[F4655, F4658]\r\n\r\nPrescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Simvastatin is a prodrug in which the 6-membered lactone ring of simvastatin is hydrolyzed <i>in vivo</i> to generate the beta,delta-dihydroxy acid, an active metabolite structurally similar to HMG-CoA (hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA). Once hydrolyzed, simvastatin competes with HMG-CoA for HMG-CoA reductase, a hepatic microsomal enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421] Simvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Simvastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL).[F4655, F4658] The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL. \r\n\r\nAt therapeutic doses, the HMG-CoA enzyme is not completely blocked by simvastatin activity, thereby allowing biologically necessary amounts of mevalonate to remain available. As mevalonate is an early step in the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol, therapy with simvastatin would also not be expected to cause any accumulation of potentially toxic sterols. In addition, HMG-CoA is metabolized readily back to acetyl-CoA, which participates in many biosynthetic processes in the body.[F4658]\r\n\r\nIn vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that simvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.\r\n\r\nStatins have also been found to bind allosterically to \u03b22 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.[A181559]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Simvastatin is an oral antilipemic agent which inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A181087, A181406]\r\n\r\nElevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]\r\n\r\n**Skeletal Muscle Effects**\r\n\r\nSimvastatin occasionally causes myopathy manifested as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above ten times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Myopathy sometimes takes the form of rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria, and rare fatalities have occurred. Predisposing factors for myopathy include advanced age (\u226565 years), female gender, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Chinese patients may also be at increased risk for myopathy. In most cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when treatment was promptly discontinued.[F4655, F4658]\r\n\r\nIn a clinical trial database of 41,413 patients, the incidence of myopathy was approximately 0.03% and 0.08% at 20 and 40 mg/day, respectively, while the risk of myopathy with simvastatin 80 mg (0.61%) was disproportionately higher than that observed at the lower doses. It's therefore recommended that the 80mg dose of simvastatin should be used only in patients who have been taking simvastatin 80 mg chronically (e.g., for 12 months or more) without evidence of muscle toxicity. As well, patients already stabilized on simvastatin 80mg should be monitored closely for evidence of muscle toxicity; if they need to be initiated on an interacting drug that is contraindicated or is associated with a dose cap for simvastatin, that patient should be switched to an alternative statin with less potential for the drug-drug interaction.[F4655, F4658]\r\n\r\nThe risk of myopathy during treatment with simvastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of interacting drugs such as [fenofibrate], [niacin], [gemfibrozil], [cyclosporine], and strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 enzyme.  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[F4655, F4658]\r\n\r\n**Liver Enzyme Abnormalities**\r\n\r\nPersistent increases (to more than 3X the ULN) in serum transaminases have occurred in approximately 1% of patients who received simvastatin in clinical studies. When drug treatment was interrupted or discontinued in these patients, the transaminase levels usually fell slowly to pretreatment levels. The increases were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. [F4655, F4658]\r\n\r\nIn the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S),[A181538] the number of patients with more than one transaminase elevation to >3 times the ULN, over the course of the study, was not significantly different between the simvastatin and placebo groups (14 [0.7%] vs. 12 [0.6%]). The frequency of single elevations of ALT to 3 times the ULN was significantly higher in the simvastatin group in the first year of the study (20 vs. 8, p=0.023), but not thereafter. In the HPS (Heart Protection Study),[A181475] in which 20,536 patients were randomized to receive simvastatin 40 mg/day or placebo, the incidences of elevated transaminases (>3X ULN confirmed by repeat test) were 0.21% (n=21) for patients treated with simvastatin and 0.09% (n=9) for patients treated with placebo.[F4655, F4658] \r\n\r\n**Endocrine Effects**\r\n\r\nIncreases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including simvastatin.[F4655]\r\n\r\nAlthough cholesterol is the precursor of all steroid hormones, studies with simvastatin have suggested that this agent has no clinical effect on steroidogenesis. Simvastatin caused no increase in biliary lithogenicity and, therefore, would not be expected to increase the incidence of gallstones.[F4658]",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: Simvastatin is administered as the inactive lactone derivative that is then metabolically activated to its \u03b2-hydroxyacid form by a combination of spontaneous chemical conversion and enzyme-mediated hydrolysis by nonspecific carboxyesterases in the intestinal wall, liver, and plasma. Oxidative metabolism in the liver is primarily mediated by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, with the remaining metabolism occurring through CYP2C8 and CYP2C9.[A181580]\r\n\r\nThe major active metabolites of simvastatin are \u03b2-hydroxyacid metabolite and its 6'-hydroxy, 6'-hydroxymethyl, and 6'-exomethylene derivatives.[F4655,F4658]\r\n\r\nPolymorphisms in the CYP3A5 gene have been shown to affect the disposition of simvastatin and may provide a plausible explanation for interindividual variability of simvastatin disposition and pharmacokinetics.[A181577]"

Once in the cell, pemetrexed is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT.

            "summary": "Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.",

Verapamil binds to these channels in a voltage- and frequency-dependent manner, meaning affinity is increased 1) as vascular smooth muscle membrane potential is reduced, and 2) with excessive depolarizing stimulus.[L10478] \r\n\r\nVerapamil's mechanism of action in the treatment of angina and hypertension is likely due to the mechanism described above. Inhibition of calcium influx prevents the contraction of vascular smooth muscle, causing relaxation/dilation of blood vessels throughout the peripheral circulation - this lowers systemic vascular resistance (i.e. afterload) and thus blood pressure. This reduction in vascular resistance also reduces the force against which the heart must push, decreasing myocardial energy consumption and oxygen requirements and thus alleviating angina.[L8791]\r\n\r\nElectrical activity through the AV node is responsible for determining heart rate, and this activity is dependent upon calcium influx through L-type calcium channels. By inhibiting these channels and decreasing the influx of calcium, verapamil prolongs the refractory period of the AV node and slows conduction, thereby slowing and controlling the heart rate in patients with arrhythmia.[L8791]\r\n\r\nVerapamil's mechanism of action in the treatment of cluster headaches is unclear, but is thought to result from an effect on other calcium channels (e.g. N-, P-, Q-, or T-type).[A13983]\r\n\r\nVerapamil is known to interact with other targets, including other calcium channels,[A188490,A13984,A188502,A15331] potassium channels,[A188496,A13985,A13983] and adrenergic receptors.[A20291,A31755]",

            "metabolism": "Metabolism: Verapamil is extensively metabolized by the liver, with up to 80% of an administered dose subject to elimination via pre-systemic metabolism - interestingly, this first-pass metabolism appears to clear the S-enantiomer of verapamil much faster than the R-enantiomer.[L10478,A415] The remaining parent drug undergoes O-demethylation, N-dealkylation, and N-demethylation to a number of different metabolites via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system.[A415] Norverapamil, one of the major circulating metabolites, is the result of verapamil's N-demethylation via CYP2C8, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5,[A415] and carries approximately 20% of the cardiovascular activity of its parent drug.[L10478] The other major pathway involved in verapamil metabolism is N-dealkylation via CYP2C8, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2 to the D-617 metabolite. Both norverapamil and D-617 are further metabolized by other CYP isoenzymes to various secondary metabolites. CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 have also been implicated in the metabolic pathway of verapamil, albeit to a minor extent.[A415] Minor pathways of verapamil metabolism involve its O-demethylation to D-703 via CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C18, and to D-702 via CYP2C9 and CYP2C18.[A415]\r\n\r\nSeveral steps in verapamil's metabolic pathway show stereoselective preference for the S-enantiomer of the given substrate, including the generation of the D-620 metabolite by CYP3A4/5 and the D-617 metabolite by CYP2C8.[A415]"

However, with continuous daily administration, nafarelin continuously occupies the GnRH receptor, leading to a reversible down-regulation of the GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland and desensitization of the pituitary gonadotropes. This causes a significant and sustained decline in the production of LH and FSH. A decline in gonadotropin production and release causes a dramatic reversible decrease in synthesis of estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone by the ovaries or testes. Like normal endometrium, endometriotic implants contain estrogen receptors. Estrogen stimulates the growth of endometrium. Use of nafarelin induces anovulation and amenorrhea and decreases serum concentrations of estradiol to the postmenopausal range, which induces atrophy of endometriotic implants. However, nafarelin does not abolish the underlying pathophysiology of endometriosis. In children with central precocious puberty receiving nafarelin, serum LH, testosterone, and estradiol concentrations return to prepubertal levels. This results in the supression of secondary sexual characteristics and decrased rate of linear growth and skeletal maturation. Following disconinuation of nafarelin, the effects of the drug is reversed, meaning FSH and LH concentrations usually return to pretreatment levels.",

At the onset of administration, nafarelin stimulates the release of the pituitary gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), resulting in a temporary increase of gonadal steroidogenesis. Repeated dosing abolishes the stimulatory effect on the pituitary gland. Twice daily administration leads to decreased secretion of gonadal steroids by about 4 weeks; consequently, tissues and functions that depend on gonadal steroids for their maintenance become quiescent. After nafarelin therapy is discontinued, pituitary and ovarian function normalize and estradiol serum concentrations increase to pretreatment levels. Recurrences of endometriosis are frequent after cessation of any hormonal therapy, or surgery that leaves the ovaries and/or uterus intact.",

Though it has long been used in the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, epinephrine in the auto-injector form (EpiPen) has been available since 1987 in the USA. Many new products/biosimilars and dosage routes have been approved under various names over the last several decades [L4355], [L4356], [L4358].  On August 16, 2018, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA gained approval to market its generic epinephrine auto-injector in 0.3 mg and 0.15 mg strengths [L4353]. Dosage delivery routes for epinephrine include intravenous, inhalation, nebulization, intramuscular injection, and subcutaneous injection.\r\n\r\nIn general, the most common uses of parenteral epinephrine are to relieve respiratory distress due to bronchospasm, to provide rapid relief of hypersensitivity (anaphylactic or anaphylactoid) reactions to drugs, animal serums and other allergens, and to prolong the action of infiltration anesthetics [F2136]. In addition to the above functions, epinephrine is the primary drug administered during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to reverse cardiac arrest [A37697], [A37699].

Epinephrine relaxes the smooth muscle of the bronchi and iris and is a histamine antagonist, rendering it useful in treating the manifestations of allergic reactions and associated conditions [F2136]. This drug also produces an increase in blood sugar and increases glycogenolysis in the liver [F1247].

Beta-2 effects produce bronchodilation which may be useful as an adjunct treatment of asthma exacerbations as well as vasodilation, tocolysis, and increased aqueous humor production [L4825]. In croup, nebulized epinephrine is associated with both clinically and statistically significant transient reduction of croup symptoms 30 minutes post-treatment [A40032]. Epinephrine also alleviates pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema and may be helpful in relieving gastrointestinal and genitourinary symptoms associated with anaphylaxis because of its relaxing effects on the smooth muscle of the stomach, intestine, uterus, and urinary bladder [FDA label].",

            "summary": "Chlorpropamide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating \u03b2 cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic \u03b2 cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Chlorpropamide is not recommended for the treatment of NIDDM as it increases blood pressure and the risk of retinopathy (UKPDS-33). Up to 80% of the single oral dose of chlorpropramide is metabolized, likely in the liver; 80-90% of the dose is excreted in urine as unchanged drug and metabolites. Renal and hepatic dysfunction may increase the risk of hypoglycemia.",

            "summary": "Galantamine is a tertiary alkaloid and reversible, competitive inhibitor of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme, which is a widely studied therapeutic target used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.[A1018] First characterized in the early 1950s, galantamine is a tertiary alkaloid that was extracted from botanical sources, such as _Galanthus nivalis_.[A201968] Galantamine was first studied in paralytic and neuropathic conditions, such as myopathies and postpolio paralytic conditions, and for reversal of neuromuscular blockade.[A182993,A201968] Following the discovery of its AChE-inhibiting properties, the cognitive effects of galantamine were studied in a wide variety of psychiatric disorders such as mild cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and autism; however, re-development of the drug for Alzheimer\u2019s disease did not commence until the early 1990s due to difficulties in extraction and synthesis.[A201968] Galantamine blocks the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, thereby increasing acetylcholine neurotransmission. It also acts as an allosteric modulator of the nicotinic receptor, giving its dual mechanism of action clinical significance.[A182993]\r\n\r\nThe drug was approved by the FDA in 2001 for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer's type. As Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, galantamine is not known to alter the course of the underlying dementing process. Galantamine works to block the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, thereby enhancing cholinergic neuron function and signalling. Under this hypothesized mechanism of action, the therapeutic effects of galantamine may decrease as the disease progression advances and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact.[L13571] It is therefore not considered to be a disease-modifying drug.[A203558] Galantamine is marketed under the brand name Razadyne, and is available as oral immediate- and extended-release tablets and solution.[L13571]",
            "indication": "Indication: Galantamine is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer\u2019s type.[L13571]",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Alzheimer\u2019s disease is characterized by progressive, irreversible degeneration of acetylcholine-producing neurons, cognitive impairment, and the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques.[A182993,A203558] The cholinergic system plays a critical role in memory, alongside other important neural functions such as attention, learning, stress response, wakefulness and sleep, and sensory information. Studies show that acetylcholine (ACh) is involved in the modulation of acquisition, encoding, consolidation, reconsolidation, extinction, and retrieval of memory. The gradual loss of cholinergic neurons in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) may, therefore, contribute to the memory loss exhibited by AD patients.[A203558] \r\n\r\nAcetylcholinesterase is secreted by cholinergic neurons to rapidly hydrolyze ACh at the synaptic cleft to release acetate and choline. Choline is later recycled back into the presynaptic cholinergic neuron via reuptake by the high-affinity choline transporter. There is some evidence demonstrating the potential involvement of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme in the formation of amyloid fibrils.[A203558] Galantamine competitively and reversibly inhibits the anticholinesterase enzyme in the CNS (namely in the frontal cortex and hippocampal regions) [A1022] by binding to the choline-binding site and acyl-binding pocket of the enzyme active site.[A1019] By blocking the breakdown of ACh, galantamine enhances ACh levels in the synaptic cleft.[A203558] \r\n\r\nNicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) in the CNS are mostly expressed at the presynaptic neuronal membrane to control the release of multiple neurotransmitters, such as ACh, glutamate, GABA, dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine.[A182993,A203558] Agonists of nAChRs improve performance in cognitive tasks, while antagonists of nAChR impair cognitive processes.[A203558] Some studies show a decrease in the expression and activity of nAChRs in patients with AD, which may explain the reduction in central cholinergic neurotransmission in these patients.[A1022] Galantamine binds to nAChRs at the allosteric site,[A182993,A203591] leading to a conformational change of the receptor, increased ACh release, and increased activity of neighbouring glutaminergic and serotoninergic neurons.[A182993] The modulation of nAChRs facilitates both excitatory and inhibitory cholinergic transmissions in brain tissues and increases receptor sensitivity. The modulated release of other neurotransmitters by galantamine may also contribute to the upregulation of nAChRs and amelioration of behavioural symptoms in AD.[A182993]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Galantamine is a competitive and reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase that works to increase acetylcholine levels.[L13571]  Galantamine acts both centrally and peripherally to inhibit both muscle and brain acetylcholinesterase, thereby increasing cholinergic tone.[A201968] Galantamine is also a positive allosteric modulator of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.[A1022,A201968] As dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, galatamine has a negligible effect in altering the course of the underlying process of dementia [L13571] and may exert its therapeutic effectiveness for a short period of time.[A203558] However, galantamine promoted improvements in cognition, global function, activities of daily living, and behavioural symptoms in clinical studies of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.[A1018,A182993]\r\n\r\nGalantamine exhibited therapeutic efficacy in studies of vascular dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease with cerebrovascular disease.[A182993] In one study, galantamine reversed scopolamine-induced acute anticholinergic syndrome that was characterized by drowsiness, disorientation, and delirium.[A201968]",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: _In vitro_ study findings suggest that about 75% of the drug is metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. CYP2D6 promotes O-demethylation of the drug to form O-desmethyl-galantamine and the CYP3A4-mediated pathway forms the galantamine-N-oxide.[A182993] Important metabolic pathways also include N-demethylation, epimerization, and sulfate conjugation.[A203444] Other metabolites include norgalantamine, O-desmethyl-galantamine, O-desmethyl-norgalantamine, epigalantamine and galantaminone, which do not retain clinically significant pharmacology activities.[A1022] \r\n\r\nGalantamine can also undergo glucuronidation: in one oral radiolabeled drug study in poor and extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers, about 14-24% of the total radioactivity was identified as galantamine glucuronide 8 hours post-dose. O-demethylation by CYP2D6 becomes prominent in patients with who are extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6, but unchanged galatamine (39-77%) and its glucuronide metabolite (14-24%) predominated in the plasma of both poor and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 in a radiolabelled drug study.[L13571] The total plasma clearance, or nonrenal clearnace, accounts for 20\u201325% of drug elimination.[A182993]"

Additional adverse effects such as necrosis, purple toe syndrome, osteoporosis, valve and artery calcification, and drug interactions have also been documented with warfarin use. Warfarin does not actually affect blood viscosity, rather, it inhibits vitamin-k dependent synthesis of biologically active forms of various clotting factors in addition to several regulatory factors.",

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Warfarin is a [vitamin K] antagonist which acts to inhibit the production of vitamin K by vitamin K epoxide reductase.[label,A179221,T116] The reduced form of vitamin K, vitamin KH<sub>2</sub> is a cofactor used in the \u03b3-carboxylation of coagulation factors VII, IX, X, and thrombin. Carboxylation induces a conformational change allowing the factors to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and to phospholipid surfaces. Uncarboxylated factors VII, IX, X, and thrombin are biologically inactive and therefore serve to interrupt the coagulation cascade. The endogenous anticoagulation proteins C and S also require  \u03b3-carboxylation to function. This is particularly true in the case of thrombin which must be activated in order to form a thrombus. vitamin KH<sub>2</sub> is converted to vitamin K epoxide as part of the \u03b3-carboxylation reaction catalyzed by \u03b3-glutamyl carboxylase. Vitamin K epoxide is then converted to vitamin K<sub>1</sub> by vitamin K epoxide reductase then back to vitamin KH<sub>2</sub> by vitamin K reductase. Warfarin binds to vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 and irreversibly inhibits the enzyme thereby stopping the recycling of vitamin K by preventing the conversion of vitamin K epoxide to vitamin K<sub>1</sub>. This process creates a hypercoagulable state for a short time as proteins C and S degrade first with half lives of 8 and 24 hours, with the exception of factor VII which has a half life of 6 hours.[A179221] Factors IX, X, and finally thrombin degrade later with half lives of 24, 36, and 50 hours resulting in a dominant anticoagulation effect.[A179221] In order to reverse this anticoagulation vitamin K must be supplied, either exogenously or by removal of the vitamin K epoxide reductase inhibition, and time allowed for new coagulation factors to be synthesized.[label,A179221,T116] It takes approximately 2 days for new coagulation factors to be synthesized in the liver. Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, functionally identical to vitamin K<sub>1</sub>, is synthesized by gut bacteria leading to interactions with antibiotics as elimination of these bacteria can reduce vitamin K<sub>2</sub supply and result in a greater anticoagulation effect.[T116]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Warfarin is an anticoagulant, as such it disrupts the coagulation cascade to reduce frequency and extent of thrombus formation.[label,L6616] In patients with deep vein thrombosis or atrial fibrillation there is an increased risk of thrombus formation due to the reduced movement of blood.[T622] For patients with cardiac valve disease or valve replacements this increased coagulability is due to tissue damage. Thrombi due to venous thrombosis can travel to the lungs and become pulmonary emboli, blocking circulation to a portion of lung tissue. Thrombi which form in the heart can travel to the brain and cause ischemic strokes. Prevention of these events is the primary goal of warfarin therapy.\r\n\r\nLimitation of thrombus formation is also a source of adverse effects. In patients with atheroscelotic plaques rupture typically results in thrombus formation.[A179212] When these patients are anticoagulated plaque rupture can allow the escape of cholesterol from the lipid core in the form of atheroemboli or cholesterol microemboli. These emboli are smaller than thrombi and block smaller vessels, usually less than 200 \u03bcm in diameter. The consequences of this are varied and depend on the location of the blockage. Effects include visual disturbances, acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease, central nervous system ischemia, and purple or blue toe syndrome.[label,A179212] Blue toe syndrome can be reversed if it has not progressed to tissue necrosis but the other effects of microemboli are often permanent.\r\n\r\nAntocoagulation appears to mediate warfarin-related nephropathy, a seemingly spontaneous kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease associated with warfarin therapy.[A179215] Nephropathy in this case appears to be due to increased passage of red blood cells through the glomerulus and subsequent blockage of renal tubules with red blood cell casts. This is worsened or possibly triggered by pre-existing kidney damage. Increased risk of warfarin-related nephropathy occurs at INRs over 3.0 but risk does not increase as a function of INR beyond this point.\r\n\r\nWarfarin has been linked to the development of calciphylaxis.[label] This is thought to be due to warfarin's inhibition of [vitamin K](VKA) recycling as VKA is needed for the carboxylation of matrix Gla protein.[A179218] This protein is an anti-calcification factor and its inhibition through preventing the carboxylation step in its production leads to a shift in calcification balance in favor of calciphylaxis. \r\n\r\nTissue necrosis can occur early on in warfarin therapy.[label] This is attributable to half lives of the clotting factors impacted by inhibition of vitamin K recycling.[label,A179221] Proteins C and S are anticoagulation factors with half lives of 8 and 24 hours respectively. The coagulation factors IX, X, VII, and thrombin (factor II) have half lives of 24, 36, 6, and 50 hours respectively. This means proteins C and S are inactivated sooner than pro-coagulation proteins, with the exception of factor VII, resulting in a pro-thrombotic state for the first few days of therapy. Thrombi which form in this time period can occlude arterioles in various locations, blocking blood flow and causing tissue necrosis due to ischemia.",

R-warfarin is metabolized to 4'-hydroxywarfarin by CYP2C8 with some contirbuting by CYP2C19, 6- and 8-hydroxywarfarin by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, 7-hydroxywarfarin by CYP1A2 and CYP2C8, and lastly to 10-hydroxywarfarin by CYP3A4.

Benzodiazepines bind to the benzodiazepine site on GABA-A receptors, which potentiates the effects of GABA by increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening.[F2434] These receptors have been identified in different body tissues including the heart and skeletal muscle, although mainly appear to be present in the central nervous system.[A173842]",

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Tobramycin is a 4,6-disubstituted 2-deoxystreptamine (DOS) ring-containing aminoglycoside antibiotic with activity against various Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria.[L32739, L32744, L32749] The mechanism of action of tobramycin has not been unambiguously elucidated, and some insights into its mechanism rely on results using similar aminoglycosides. In general, like other aminoglycosides, tobramycin is bactericidal and exhibits both immediate and delayed killing, which are attributed to different mechanisms, as outlined below.[A232294, A232299]\r\n\r\nAminoglycosides are polycationic at physiological pH, such that they readily bind to bacterial membranes (\"ionic binding\"); this includes binding to lipopolysaccharide and phospholipids within the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and to teichoic acid and phospholipids within the cell membrane of Gram-positive bacteria. This binding displaces divalent cations and increases membrane permeability, which allows aminoglycoside entry.[A232294, A232304, A232309, A232314] Additional aminoglycoside entry (\"energy-dependent phase I\") into the cytoplasm requires the proton-motive force, allowing access of the aminoglycoside to its primary intracellular target of the bacterial 30S ribosome.[A232294, A232314] Mistranslated proteins produced as a result of aminoglycoside binding to the ribosome (see below) integrate into and disrupt the cell membrane, which allows more of the aminoglycoside into the cell (\"energy-dependent phase II\").[A232294, A232314, A232319] Hence, tobramycin and other aminoglycosides have both immediate bactericidal effects through membrane disruption and delayed bactericidal effects through impaired protein synthesis; observed experimental data and mathematical modelling support this two-mechanism model.[A232294, A232299]\r\n\r\nInhibition of protein synthesis was the first recognized effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Structural and cell biological studies suggest that aminoglycosides bind to the 16S rRNA in helix 44 (h44), near the A site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, altering interactions between h44 and h45. This binding also displaces two important residues, A1492 and A1493, from h44, mimicking normal conformational changes that occur with successful codon-anticodon pairing in the A site.[A232324, A232329] Overall, aminoglycoside binding has several negative effects, including inhibiting translation initiation and elongation and ribosome recycling.[A232294, A232334, A232339] Recent evidence suggests that the latter effect is due to a cryptic second binding site situated in h69 of the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit.[A232329, A232339] Also, by stabilizing a conformation that mimics correct codon-anticodon pairing, aminoglycosides promote error-prone translation;[A232344] mistranslated proteins can incorporate into the cell membrane, inducing the damage discussed above.[A232294, A232319]\r\n\r\nAlthough direct mutation of the 16S rRNA is a rare resistance mechanism, due to the gene being present in numerous copies, posttranscriptional 16S rRNA modification by 16S rRNA methyltransferases (16S-RMTases) at the N7 position of G1405 or the N1 position of A1408 are common resistance mechanisms in aminoglycoside-resistant bacteria.[A232294, A232349] These mutants also further support the proposed mechanism of action of aminoglycosides. Direct modification of the aminoglycoside itself through acetylation, adenylation, and phosphorylation by aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AMEs) are also commonly encountered resistance mutations.[A232294, A232349] Finally, due to the requirement for active transport of aminoglycosides across bacterial membranes, they are not active against obligately anaerobic bacteria.[A232294]",

It is not used widely due to the risk of hepatotoxicity. It tends to have better gram-positive bacterial coverage and less gram-negative coverage than the previous fluoroquinolones. Mechanism of action of fluoroquinolones including trovafloxacin is different from that of penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, macrolides, and tetracyclines. Therefore fluoroquinolones may be active against pathogens that are resistant to these antibiotics. There is no cross-resistance between trovafloxacin and the mentioned classes of antibiotics. The overall results obtained from in vitro synergy studies, testing combinations of trovafloxacin with beta-lactams and aminoglycosides, indicate that synergy is strain specific and not commonly encountered. This agrees with results obtained previously with other fluoroquinolones. Resistance to trovafloxacin in vitro develops slowly via multiple-step mutation in a manner similar to other fluoroquinolones. Resistance to trovafloxacin in vitro occurs at a general frequency of between 1x10<sup>-7</sup> to 10<sup>-10</sup>. Although cross-resistance has been observed between trovafloxacin and some other fluoroquinolones, some microorganisms resistant to other fluoroquinolones may be susceptible to trovafloxacin.",

Fludrocortisone may also exert a direct effect on plasma sodium levels via action at the Na<sup>+</sup>-H<sup>+</sup> exchanger found in the apical membrane of renal tubule cells.[T28]\r\n\r\nFludrocortisone also acts on glucocorticoid receptors, albeit with a much lower affinity - the glucocorticoid potency of fludrocortisone is approximately 5-10 times that of endogenous cortisol, whereas its mineralocorticoid potency is 200-400 times greater.[A5423]",

The reduction in 11\u03b2-oxidation is thought to be one of the reasons behind fludrocortisone's profound mineralocorticoid potency.[A5423] An _in vitro_ study generated only two metabolites following incubation in human liver microsomes and cytosol, namely 20\u03b2-dihydrofluorocortisol and 6\u03b2-hydroxyfluorocortisol, and did not explore in detail the potential enzymes responsible for this reaction.[A187162]\r\n\r\nGiven that fludrocortisone is a corticosteroid, a class of medications known to be metabolized by the CYP3A family,[A14813] and is not recommended to be given with strong inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A,[L8974] it is likely that the CYP3A family of enzymes contributes in some way to its metabolism (though this information does not appear to have been specifically elucidated for fludrocortisone)."

The mechanism through which moexiprilat lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily inhibition of ACE activity. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of the inactive decapeptide angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent peripheral vasoconstrictor that also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex and provides negative feedback on renin secretion. ACE is identical to kininase II, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin, an endothelium-dependent vasodilator. Moexiprilat is about 1000 times as potent as moexipril in inhibiting ACE and kininase II. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased angiotensin II formation, leading to decreased vasoconstriction, increased plasma renin activity, and decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter results in diuresis and natriuresis and a small increase in serum potassium concentration (mean increases of about 0.25 mEq/L were seen when moexipril was used alone). Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of moexipril remains to be elucidated.

            "indication": "Indication: Furosemide is indicated for the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and renal disease, including the nephrotic syndrome, in adults and pediatric patients.[L7958] \r\n\r\nOral furosemide is indicated alone for the management of mild to moderate hypertension or severe hypertension in combination with other antihypertensive medications.[L9659]\r\n\r\nIntravenous furosemide is indicated as adjunctive therapy in acute pulmonary edema when a rapid onset of diuresis is desired.[L7958]\r\n\r\nSubcutaneous furosemide is indicated for the treatment of congestion due to fluid overload in adults with NYHA Class II/III chronic heart failure. This drug formulation is not indicated for emergency situations or in patients with acute pulmonary edema.[L43408]",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Furosemide promotes diuresis by blocking tubular reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the proximal and distal tubules, as well as in the thick ascending loop of Henle. This diuretic effect is achieved through the competitive inhibition of sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporters (NKCC2) expressed along these tubules in the nephron, preventing the transport of sodium ions from the lumenal side into the basolateral side for reabsorption. This inhibition results in increased excretion of water along with sodium, chloride, magnesium, calcium, hydrogen, and potassium ions.[L7961] As with other loop diuretics, furosemide decreases the excretion of uric acid.[T28] \r\n\r\nFurosemide exerts direct vasodilatory effects, which results in its therapeutic effectiveness in the treatment of acute pulmonary edema. Vasodilation leads to reduced responsiveness to vasoconstrictors, such as angiotensin II and noradrenaline, and decreased production of endogenous natriuretic hormones with vasoconstricting properties. It also leads to increased production of prostaglandins with vasodilating properties. Furosemide may also open potassium channels in resistance arteries.[T28] The main mechanism of action of furosemide is independent of its inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase and aldosterone.[L7958] ",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Furosemide manages hypertension and edema associated with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, and renal disease, including the nephrotic syndrome. Furosemide is a potent loop diuretic that works to increase the excretion of Na+ and water by the kidneys by inhibiting their reabsorption from the proximal and distal tubules, as well as the loop of Henle.[L7958] It works directly acts on the cells of the nephron and indirectly modifies the content of the renal filtrate.[T28] Ultimately, furosemide increases the urine output by the kidney. Protein-bound furosemide is delivered to its site of action in the kidneys and secreted via active secretion by nonspecific organic transporters expressed at the luminal site of action.[A31831,L7958] \r\n\r\nFollowing oral administration, the onset of the diuretic effect is about 1 and 1.5 hours [L7958], and the peak effect is reached within the first 2 hours.[L7961] The duration of effect following oral administration is about 4-6 hours but may last up to 8 hours.[L9659] Following intravenous administration, the onset of effect is within 5 minutes, and the peak effect is reached within 30 minutes. The duration of action following intravenous administration is approximately 2 hours. Following intramuscular administration, the onset of action is somewhat delayed.[L7958]",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: The metabolism of furosemide occurs mainly in the kidneys and the liver, to a smaller extent. The kidneys are responsible for about 85% of total furosemide total clearance, where about 40% involves biotransformation.[A183563] Two major metabolites of furosemide are furosemide glucuronide, which is pharmacologically active, and saluamine (CSA) or 4-chloro-5-sulfamoylanthranilic acid.[A183281]"

Regardless of the cause, muscle spasticity can be an extremely painful and debilitating condition. \r\n\r\nInitially approved by the FDA in 1996, tizanidine is an Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist reducing spasticity by the presynaptic inhibition of excitatory neurotransmitters that cause firing of neurons promoting muscle spasm [FDA label].",

The above reduction and excitatory neurotransmitter release results in presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The strongest effect of tizanidine has been shown to occur on spinal polysynaptic pathways.   The anti-nociceptive and anticonvulsant activities of tizanidine may also be attributed to agonist action on Alpha-2 receptors.

In animal models, tizanidine has not been shown to exert direct effects on skeletal muscle fibers or the neuromuscular junction, and has shown no significant effect on monosynaptic spinal reflexes (consisting of the communication between only 1 sensory neuron and 1 motor neuron) [L6064]. The frequency of muscle spasm and clonus are shown to be decreased by tizanidine [T574]. Tizanidine shows a stronger action on polysynaptic reflexes, which involve several interneurons (relay neurons) communicating with motor neurons stimulating muscle movement [L6064].\r\n\r\n**Effects on blood pressure and heart rate**\r\n\r\nThis drug decreases heart rate and blood pressure in humans [A177559, A177589].

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Sufentanil is a synthetic, potent opioid with highly selective binding to \u03bc-opioid receptors [F2009]. These receptors are widely distributed in the human brain, spinal cord, and other tissues [A39636], [A39637].\r\n\r\nIn general, opioids decrease cAMP (affecting neural signaling pathways), decrease neurotransmitter release, and cause membrane hyperpolarization, all of which contribute to the relief of painful symptoms [A39637].\r\n\r\nOpiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic neural transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate receptor leads to the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP, located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. The release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine, and noradrenaline is then inhibited [A39637]. \r\n\r\nOpioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist), also preventing neurotransmitter release [A39637].\r\n\r\nSufentanil and other opioids open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels, resulting in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability [A39636], [A39637]. ",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: **Effect on the Central Nervous System (CNS)**\r\n\r\n In clinical settings, sufentanil exerts its principal pharmacologic effects on the central nervous system. Its primary therapeutic actions are analgesia and sedation. Sufentanil may increase pain tolerance and decrease the perception of pain. This drug depresses the respiratory centers, depresses the cough reflex, and constricts the pupils [F2009], [A39637]. When used in balanced general anesthesia, sufentanil has been reported to be as much as 10 times as potent as fentanyl. When administered intravenously as a primary anesthetic agent with 100% oxygen, sufentanil is approximately 5 to 7 times as potent as fentanyl [FDA label]. High doses of intravenous sufentanil have been shown to cause muscle rigidity, likely as a result of an effect on the substantia nigra and the striate nucleus in the brain. Sleep-inducing (hypnotic) activity can be demonstrated by EEG alterations [FDA label].\r\n\r\n**Effects on the Respiratory System**\r\n\r\nSufentanil may cause respiratory depression [FDA label].\r\n\r\n**Effects on the Cardiovascular System**\r\n\r\nSufentanil causes peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Bradycardia may also occur [F2009]. Clinical signs or symptoms of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension [FDA label].\r\n\r\n**Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract**\r\n\r\nSufentanil causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in both the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine may be delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased and lead to spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, as well as temporary elevations in serum amylase [FDA label].",

Suppression of these hormones prevents follicular development, ovulation, and corpus luteum development.[A37129] \r\n\r\nWhen used as a component of hormone replacement therapy in menopausal women, norethisterone\u2019s value is mainly in suppressing the growth of the endometrium.[A188156] As estrogen stimulates endometrial growth, the unopposed use of estrogen in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus can lead to endometrial hyperplasia which can increase the risk of endometrial cancer. The addition of a progestin to a hormone replacement therapy in this population protects against this endometrial hyperplasia and, therefore, lowers the risk associated with the use of hormone replacement therapies.\r\n\r\nNorethisterone, along with other progestins and endogenous progesterone, has a low affinity for other steroid receptors, such as the androgen receptor and glucocorticoid receptor.[A10367,A188075] While affinity and agonistic activity at these receptors is minimal, it is thought that androgen receptor agonism is responsible for some of the adverse effects observed with progestin use (e.g. acne, serum lipid changes).[A10367]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Norethisterone is a synthetic oral progestin used for contraception or to treat other hormone-related conditions such as menopausal symptoms and endometriosis. As a synthetic progestin, norethisterone acts similarly to endogenous progesterone but with a much higher potency - it acts at the pelvic level to alter cervical and endometrial function, as well as via the inhibition of pituitary hormones that play a role in follicular maturation and ovulation.[L9527] A small increase in the risk of developing breast cancer has been observed in patients using combined oral contraceptives, with some evidence also implicating progestin-only pills - patients starting hormonal contraception should be advised of this risk and should employ routine breast self-examinations to check for evidence of any developing masses.[L9527]",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: Norethisterone is extensively metabolized, primarily in the liver, to a number of metabolites via partial and total reduction of its A-ring.[A188078] The enzymes predominantly involved are 3\u03b1- and 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) as well as 5\u03b1- and 5\u03b2-reductase.[A188078,A188075] The 5\u03b1-reduced metabolites, including 5\u03b1-dihydronorethisterone and its derivatives, appear to carry biological activity while the 5\u03b2-reduced metabolites appear inactive.[A188075] Norethisterone and its metabolites are also extensively conjugated - most of the plasmatic metabolites are sulfate conjugates, while most of the urinary metabolites are glucuronide conjugates.[A188072,L10307] The major metabolites in plasma are a disulfate conjugate of 3\u03b1,5\u03b1-tetrahydronorethisterone and a monosulfate conjugate of 3\u03b1,5\u03b2-tetrahydronorethisterone, while the major metabolite(s) in the urine are comprised of glucuronide and/or sulfate conjugates of 3\u03b1,5\u03b2-tetrahydronorethisterone.[A188150]\r\n\r\nNorethisterone has also been observed to undergo some degree of metabolism via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, predominantly by CYP3A4 and, to a much lesser extent, by CYP2C19, CYP1A2, and CYP2A6.[A35871] The metabolites generated by these reactions have not been fully characterized."

This action is antagonized by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine and edrophonium. Rocuronium acts by competitively binding to nicotinic cholinergic receptors. The binding of vecuronium decreases the opportunity for acetylcholine to bind to the nicotinic receptor at the postjunctional membrane of the myoneural junction. As a result, depolarization is prevented, calcium ions are not released and muscle contraction does not occur. Evidence also suggests that nondepolarizing agents can affect ACh release. It has been hypothesized that nondepolarzing agents bind to postjunctional (\"curare\") receptors and may therefore interfere with the sodium and potassium flux, which is responsible for depolarization and repolarization of the membranes involved in muscle contraction.

Nateglinide is an amino acid derivative that induces an early insulin response to meals decreasing postprandial blood glucose levels. It should only be taken with meals and meal-time doses should be skipped with any skipped meal. Approximately one month of therapy is required before a decrease in fasting blood glucose is seen. Meglitnides may have a neutral effect on weight or cause a slight increase in weight. The average weight gain caused by meglitinides appears to be lower than that caused by sulfonylureas and insulin and appears to occur only in those na\u00efve to oral antidiabetic agents. Due to their mechanism of action, meglitinides may cause hypoglycemia although the risk is thought to be lower than that of sulfonylureas since their action is dependent on the presence of glucose. In addition to reducing postprandial and fasting blood glucose, meglitnides have been shown to decrease glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, which are reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control. Meglitinides appear to be more effective at lowering postprandial blood glucose than metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones.

The insulinotropic effects of nateglinide are highest at intermediate glucose levels (3 to 10 mmol/L) and it does not increase insulin release already stimulated by high glucose concentrations (greater than 15 mmol/L).

Membrane potential is regulated through an inverse relationship between the activity of cell membrane ATP-sensitive potassium channels (ABCC8) and extracellular glucose concentrations. Extracellular glucose enters the cell via GLUT2 (SLC2A2) transporters. Once inside the cell, glucose is metabolized to produce ATP. High concentrations of ATP inhibit ATP-sensitive potassium channels causing membrane depolarization. When extracellular glucose concentrations are low, ATP-sensitive potassium channels open causing membrane repolarization. High glucose concentrations cause ATP-sensitive potassium channels to close resulting in membrane depolarization and opening of L-type calcium channels. The influx of calcium ions stimulates calcium-dependent exocytosis of insulin granules.

A higher occupancy rate of D2 receptors is said to increase the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms and is therefore to be avoided.[A1118,A1119,A31771] \r\n \r\nIncreased serotonergic mesocortical activity in schizophrenia results in negative symptoms, such as depression and decreased motivation. The high-affinity binding of risperidone to 5-HT2A receptors leads to a decrease in serotonergic activity. In addition, 5-HT2A receptor blockade results in decreased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms, likely by increasing dopamine release from the frontal cortex, and not the nigrostriatal tract. Dopamine level is therefore not completely inhibited.[A1117,A1119] Through the above mechanisms, both serotonergic and D2 blockade by risperidone are thought to synergistically work to decrease the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. \r\n \r\nRisperidone has also been said to be an antagonist of alpha-1 (\u03b11), alpha-2 (\u03b12), and histamine (H1) receptors.[A37034] Blockade of these receptors is thought to improve symptoms of schizophrenia, however the exact mechanism of action on these receptors is not fully understood at this time.[L12885]",

This effect is dose-related and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus.\r\n\r\nEsomeprazole is the s-isomer of [DB00338], which is a racemate of the S- and R-enantiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as [DB00338], without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_. \r\n\r\nPPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]\r\n\r\nDue to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack antisecretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole\u2019s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite. CYP2C19 isoenzyme exhibits polymorphism in the metabolism of esomeprazole, since some 3% of Caucasians and 15 to 20% of Asians lack CYP2C19 and are termed Poor Metabolizers.[FDA Label] However, the influence of CYP 2C19 polymorphism is less pronounced for esomeprazole than for omeprazole.[F4495] At steady state, the ratio of AUC in Poor Metabolizers to AUC in the rest of the population (Extensive Metabolizers) is approximately 2.\r\n\r\nFollowing administration of equimolar doses, the S- and R-isomers are metabolized differently by the liver, resulting in higher plasma levels of the S- than of the R-isomer.[FDA Label]\r\n\r\nNine major urinary metabolites have been detected. The two main metabolites have been identified as hydroxyesomeprazole and the corresponding carboxylic acid. Three major metabolites have been identified in plasma: the 5-O-desmethyl- and sulphone derivatives and hydroxyesomeprazole. The major metabolites of esomeprazole have no effect on gastric acid secretion.[F4495]"

Different receptors responding to different factors, including histamine, 5-HT, enkephalins, substance P, and dopamine, are expressed along the brainstem to activate respective pathways and contribute to the control of vomiting. Histamine H1 receptors are expressed on the vestibular nuclei and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) that are activated by motion sickness and stimuli from the pharynx and stomach. When activated, H1 receptor signaling from these nuclei is transmitted to the CTZ and vomiting centre.[T28] \r\n\r\nThrough its antagonistic action on the H1 receptors, meclizine primarily works by inhibiting signaling pathway transduction through histaminergic neurotransmission from the vestibular nuclei and NTS to the CTZ and medullary vomiting center.[A179581] Meclizine may also decrease the labyrinth excitability and vestibular stimulation.[L6760]",

            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Modafinil is a stimulant drug marketed as a 'wakefulness promoting agent' and is one of the stimulants used in the treatment of narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is caused by dysfunction of a family of wakefulness-promoting and sleep-suppressing peptides, the orexins, whose neurons are activated by modafinil. The prexin neuron activation is associated with psychoactivation and euphoria. Modafinil is not indicated for complaints of lack of energy or fatigue; but it appears to be very helpful for some patients. Also, it has been used in the treatment of hypersomnia, a disorder in which patients lack the capacity for meaningful sleep and may require ten or more hours per day. Recent studies have have found that modafinil may help recovering cocaine addicts fight their addiction.",

Deferoxamine works in treating aluminum toxicity by binding to tissue-bound aluminum to form aluminoxamine, a stable, water-soluble complex. The formation of aluminoxamine increases blood concentrations of aluminum, resulting in an increased concentration gradient between the blood and dialysate, boosting the removal of aluminum during dialysis. 100 mg of deferoxamine is capable of binding approximately 4.1 mg of aluminum.",

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: [Acetylcholine] (ACh) is a neurotransmitter that can signal through ligand-gated cation channels (nicotinic receptors) and G-protein-coupled muscarinic receptors (mAChRs). ACh signalling via mAChRs located in the central nervous system (CNS) and periphery can regulate smooth muscle contraction, glandular secretions, heart rate, and various neurological phenomena such as learning and memory.[A228738, A228743] mAChRs can be divided into five subtypes, M1-M5, expressed at various levels throughout the brain.[A228743] Also, M2 receptors are found in the heart and M3 receptors in smooth muscles, mediating effects apart from the direct modulation of the parasympathetic nervous system.[A228423] While M1, M3, and M5 mAChRs primarily couple to G<sub>q</sub> proteins to activate phospholipase C, M2 and M4 mainly couple to G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins to inhibit adenylyl cyclase and modulate cellular ion flow.[A228743] This system, in part, helps to control physiological responses such as nausea and vomiting.[L31578]\r\n\r\nScopolamine acts as a non-selective competitive inhibitor of M1-M5 mAChRs, albeit with weaker M5 inhibition; as such, scopolamine is an anticholinergic with various dose-dependent therapeutic and adverse effects.[A228423, A228758, A228763] The exact mechanism(s) of action of scopolamine remains poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests that M1 (and possibly M2) mAChR antagonism at interneurons acts through inhibition of downstream neurotransmitter release and subsequent pyramidal neuron activation to mediate neurological responses associated with stress and depression.[A228773] Similar antagonism of M4 and M5 receptors is associated with potential therapeutic benefits in neurological conditions such as schizophrenia and substance abuse disorders.[A228743] The significance of these observations to scopolamine's current therapeutic indications of preventing nausea and vomiting is unclear but is linked to its anticholinergic effect and ability to alter signalling through the CNS associated with vomiting.[A228758, L31578]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Scopolamine is an anticholinergic belladonna alkaloid that, through competitive inhibition of muscarinic receptors, affects parasympathetic nervous system function and acts on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. Formulated as a patch, scopolamine is released continuously over three days and remains detectable in urine over a period of 108 hours. Scopolamine is contraindicated in angle-closure glaucoma and should be used with caution in patients with open-angle glaucoma due to scopolamine's ability to increase intraocular pressure. Also, scopolamine exhibits several neuropsychiatric effects: exacerbated psychosis, seizures, seizure-like, and other psychiatric reactions, and cognitive impairment; scopolamine may impair the ability of patients to operate machinery or motor vehicles, play underwater sports, or perform any other potentially hazardous activity. Women with severe preeclampsia should avoid scopolamine. Patients with gastrointestinal or urinary disorders should be monitored frequently for impairments, and scopolamine should be discontinued if these develop. Scopolamine can cause blurred vision if applied directly to the eye, and the transdermal patch should be removed before an MRI procedure to avoid skin burns. Due to its gastrointestinal effects, scopolamine can interfere with gastric secretion testing and should be discontinued at least 10 days before performing the test. Finally, scopolamine may induce dependence and resulting withdrawal symptoms, such as nausea, dizziness, vomiting, gastrointestinal disturbances, sweating, headaches, bradycardia, hypotension, and various neuropsychiatric manifestations following treatment discontinuation; severe symptoms may require medical attention.[L31578]",

It also is used commonly to treat drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms as well as to treat mild cases of Parkinson's disease.

Carbinoxamine competitively antagonizes the effects of histamine on HA-receptors in the GI tract, uterus, large blood vessels, and bronchial muscle.

Tretinoin is believed to exert its pharmacological actions by binding to and activating two types of nuclear receptors - retinoic acid receptors (RARs) alpha, beta, and gamma and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). In the human skin, RARs (especially RAR-alpha) form heterodimers with RXR to act as inducible transcription regulators of genes involved in cell differentiation by binding to retinoic acid response elements.[A257724,A258185] Tretinoin binds to RXRs to promote epidermal proliferation. It also blocks the actions of inflammatory mediators, enhancing procollagen production and collagen type I and III formations.[A257474,A257629,A257609,A257699] Some animal and human studies suggest that tretinoin induces the expression of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2), which stimulates the transcription of several types of collagen messenger RNA. Collagen formation curtails further solar UV-induced skin damage and aging processes.[A257699]\r\n\r\nAcne is associated with abnormal follicular formation from excessive keratinization of epithelial cells. Tretinoin promotes cornified cell detachment and enhances keratinocyte shedding. It also stimulates mitotic activity and loosely-adherent corneocyte turnover to expel comedo contents, reducing microcomedo precursor lesions of acne vulgaris.[A257474,L34869] Tretinoin may reduce epidermal melanin and pigmentation by increasing keratinocyte turnover and reducing tyrosinase activity.[A257609,A258180]\r\n\r\nRAR-alpha and -beta have also been implicated in APL.[A257724] APL is characterized by a t(15;17) chromosomal translocation, which fuses the promyelocytic myeloid leukemia (PML) gene with the RAR-alpha gene.[A257689,A257694] The resulting PML-RAR-alpha fusion protein plays a role in the pathogenesis of APL by aberrating promyelocyte differentiation. The PML-RAR-alpha fusion protein is found to be predominant in leukemic cells, exerting a dominant negative effect on RAR, RXR and PML function.[A257689] Tretinoin induces terminal differentiation in hemopoietic precursor cell lines and APL cells.[A257694] Tretinoin is believed to promote caspase-mediated cleavage and proteasome-dependent degradation to cause apoptosis and degradation of the PML-RAR-alpha fusion protein.[A257474] It may also convert the fusion protein from a transcription repressor to an activator.[A257474]",

Potassium ions participate in a number of essential physiological processes including the maintenance of intracellular tonicity, the transmission of nerve impulses, the contraction of cardiac, skeletal and smooth muscle, and the maintenance of normal renal function. The intracellular concentration of potassium is approximately 150 to 160 mEq per liter. The normal adult plasma concentration is 3.5 to 5 mEq per liter. An active ion transport system maintains this gradient across the plasma membrane. Potassium is a normal dietary constituent and under steady-state conditions the amount of potassium absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is equal to the amount excreted in the urine. The usual dietary intake of potassium is 50 to 100 mEq per day. Potassium depletion will occur whenever the rate of potassium loss through renal excretion and/or loss from the gastrointestinal tract exceeds the rate of potassium intake. Such depletion usually develops as a consequence of therapy with diuretics, primarily or secondary hyperaldosteronism, diabetic ketoacidosis, or inadequate replacement of potassium in patients on prolonged parenteral nutrition. Depletion can develop rapidly with severe diarrhea, especially if associated with vomiting. Potassium depletion due to these causes is usually accompanied by concomitant loss of chloride and is manifested by hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Potassium depletion may produce weakness, fatigue, disturbances of cardiac rhythm (primarily ectopic beats), prominent U-waves in the electrocardiogram, and, in advanced cases, flaccid paralysis and/or impaired ability to concentrate urine. If potassium depletion associated with metabolic alkalosis cannot be managed by correcting the fundamental cause of the deficiency, e.g., where the patient requires long-term diuretic therapy, supplemental potassium in the form of high potassium food or potassium chloride may be able to restore normal potassium levels. In rare circumstances (e.g., patients with renal tubular acidosis) potassium depletion may be associated with metabolic acidosis and hyperchloremia. In such patients, potassium replacement should be accomplished with potassium salts other than the chloride, such as potassium bicarbonate, potassium citrate, potassium acetate, or potassium gluconate.",

Irinotecan is a semisynthetic derivative of camptothecin. Camptothecins interact specifically with topoisomerase I, an enzyme in the cell nucleus that regulates DNA topology and facilitates nuclear processes such as DNA replication, recombination, and repair. During these processes, topoisomerase I relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks, allowing single DNA strands to pass through the break. The 3'-DNA terminus of the broken DNA strands bind covalently with the topoisomerase enzyme to form a catalytic intermediate called a cleavable complex. After the DNA is sufficiently relaxed and the strand passage reaction is complete, DNA topoisomerase reattaches the broken DNA strands to form the chemically unaltered topoisomers that allow transcription to proceed. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either Irinotecan or SN-38. Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double-strand breaks. The precise contribution of SN-38 to the activity of irinotecan in humans is not known.

Despite documented teratogenic effects in its published labels,[L8336,L8339] the true teratogenicity of methimazole appears to be unclear[A184643,A184757,A184763] and its place in therapy may change in the future.",

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Histamine is a biogenic vasoactive amine that binds to its receptors, which are G-protein coupled receptors. Signaling through the histamine H1 receptor is thought to primarily promote the activation of inflammatory reactions, such as allergy, asthma, and autoimmune diseases.[A179731] H1 receptor signaling activates the intracellular transcription factors, such as IP3, PLC, PKC, DAG, and intracellular calcium ions, which all work to activate further downstream cascades. Activated downstream cascades lead to the production of cytokines, the release of mast cell inflammatory mediators, synthesis of prostacyclins, activation of platelet factor, as well as the synthesis of nitric oxide, arachidonic acid, and thromboxane, which all contribute to inflammatory reactions.[A179731] \r\n\r\nOlopatadine is an anti-allergic molecule that works via several mechanisms. As a mast cell stabilizer, it stabilizes rodent basophils and human conjunctival mast cells and inhibits the immunologically-stimulated release of histamine.[A179704] Olopatadine acts as an antagonist at the histamine H1 receptors with high selectivity, which is explained by a unique receptor binding pocket that consists of the aspartate residue in the third transmembrane helix and other sites in the H1 receptor.[A1170] Upon binding, olopatadine blocks the H1 receptor signaling pathway, inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators, such as tryptase, prostaglandin D2, TNF-alpha, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines.[L6790] It also decreases chemotaxis and inhibits eosinophil activation.[L6781] _In vitro_, olopatadine was shown to inhibit epithelial cell intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which promotes the recruitment of migrating pro-inflammatory mediators.[A179704]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Inflammatory reactions in response to various stimuli are mediated by endogenous mediators and other pro-inflammatory factors. Histamine receptor activation and mast cell degranulation are primary mechanisms that cause inflammatory reactions such as ocular itching, hyperemia, chemosis, eyelid swelling, and tearing of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis.[A179704] Olopatadine is an anti-allergenic molecule and mast cell stabilizer that inhibits the _in vivo_ type 1 immediate hypersensitivity reaction.[L6790] By blocking the effects of histamine, olopatadine works to reduce the symptoms of allergies and inflammation at various sites of administration, including the eyes and nose. It has shown to exert antihistaminic effects in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans.[L6784] Olopatadine also demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of immunologically-stimulated release of histamine from rat basophilic leukemia cells and human conjunctival mast cells _in vitro_.[A179704] Olopatadine has a relatively rapid onset of action and prolonged duration, where it was shown to mediate anti-histaminic effects at 5 minutes to 24 hours post-administration.[A179704]\r\n\r\nWhile olopatadine is a non-sedating antihistamine agent, there have been reports of somnolence in some patients taking nasal olopatadine during clinical trials.[L6784] Temporary blurred vision or other visual disturbances were observed following ophthalmic administration. Olopatadine has negligible effects on alpha-adrenergic, dopamine, muscarinic type 1 and 2, and serotonin receptors.[L6790] In clinical trials, there was no evidence of any effect of olopatadine on QT prolongation was observed following intranasal administration.[L6784]",

Technically, the term corticosteroid refers to both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, but is often used as a synonym for glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids suppress cell-mediated immunity. They act by inhibiting genes that code for the cytokines IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha, the most important of which is the IL-2. Reduced cytokine production limits T cell proliferation. Glucocorticoids also suppress humoral immunity, causing B cells to express lower amounts of IL-2 and IL-2 receptors.

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Estrogen is found in the the breast, uterine, ovarian, skin, prostate, bone, fat, and brain tissues. The main source of estrogen in adult women during the reproductive period of life is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol each day. After menopause, however, the majority of endogenous estrogen is produced by transformation of androstenedione (which is secreted by the adrenal cortex) to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Both estrone and its sulphate conjugated form, estrone sulphate, represent the most abundant estrogens found in postmenopausal women.[L11530] \r\n\r\nEstradiol, however, is considerably more potent than estrone and estriol at the estrogen receptor (ER). As a result, the higher estrone concentration in postmenopausal population, can cause various undesirable effects. These effects may include hot flashes, chills, vaginal dryness, mood swings, irregular menstruation, and chills, in addition to sleep problems.[L11530]\r\n\r\nEstradiol workings by binding to subtypes of the estrogen receptor: estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) and estrogen receptor beta (ER\u03b2). It also exerts potent agonism of G Protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), which is recognized an important regulator of this drug's rapid effects. Once the estrogen receptor has bound to its ligand, it enters the nucleus of the target cell, regulating gene transcription and formation of of messenger RNA. This mRNA makes contact with ribosomes producing specific proteins that express the effect of estradiol upon the target cell. Agonism of estrogen receptors increases pro-estrogenic effects, leading to the relief of vasomotor and urogenital symptoms of a postmenopausal or low estradiol state.[A31620,L11485,L11497]\r\n\r\n",

Estrogen appears to inhibit bone resorption [A190402,L11560] and may have beneficial effects on the plasma lipid profile.[A190405,L11530] Estrogens cause an increase in hepatic synthesis of various proteins, which include sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), and thyroid-binding globulin (TBG).  Estrogens are known to suppress the formation of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in the anterior pituitary gland.[L11485] \r\n\r\n**A note on hyper-coagulable state, cardiovascular health, and blood pressure**\r\n\r\nEstradiol may cause an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, DVT, and stroke, and its use should be avoided in patients at high risk of these conditions.[L11560]  Estrogen induces a hyper-coagulable state, which is also associated with both estrogen-containing oral contraceptive (OC) use and pregnancy.

MR images are based primarily on proton density and proton relaxation dynamics. MR instruments are sensitive to two different relaxation processes, the T1 (spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation time) and T2 (spin-spin or transverse relaxation time). Paramagnetic agents contain one or more unpaired electrons that enhance the T1 and T2 relaxation rates of protons in their molecular environment. The proton relaxation effect (PRE) of an unpaired electron is 700 times stronger than that of a proton itself. In MRI, visualization of normal and pathological brain tissue depends in part on variations in the radio frequency signal intensity that occur with changes in proton density, alteration of the T1, and variation in T2. When placed in a magnetic field, gadopentetate dimeglumine shortens the T1 and T2 relaxation times in tissues where it accumulates. In the central nervous system (CNS), gadopentetate dimeglumine enhances visualization of normal tissues that lack a blood-brain barrier, such as the pituitary gland and the meninges. Gadopentetate dimeglumine does not cross the intact blood-brain barrier; therefore, it does not accumulate in normal brain tissue or in CNS lesions that have not caused an abnormal blood-brain barrier (e.g., cysts, mature post-operative scars). Abnormal vascularity or disruption of the blood-brain barrier allows accumulation of gadopentetate dimeglumine in lesions such as neoplasms, abscesses, and subacute infarcts. Outside the CNS, gadopentetate dimeglumine rapidly reaches equilibrium in the interstitial compartment and enhances signal in all tissues as a function of delivery and size of the interstitial compartment.\r\nThis compound has also been found to inhibit human erythrocyte 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase.",

Candesartan lowers blood pressure by antagonizing the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS); it competes with angiotensin II for binding to the type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1) subtype and prevents the blood pressure increasing effects of angiotensin II. Unlike angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, ARBs do not have the adverse effect of dry cough.

            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Candesartan cilexetil is an ARB prodrug that is rapidly converted to candesartan, its active metabolite, during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Candesartan confers blood pressure lowering effects by antagonizing the hypertensive effects of angiotensin II via the RAAS. RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. Renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is cleaved by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II increases blood pressure by increasing total peripheral resistance, increasing sodium and water reabsorption in the kidneys via aldosterone secretion, and altering cardiovascular structure. Angiotensin II binds to two receptors: type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1) and type-2 angiotensin II receptor (AT2). AT1 is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that mediates the vasoconstrictive and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II. Studies performed in recent years suggest that AT2 antagonizes AT1-mediated effects and directly affects long-term blood pressure control by inducing vasorelaxation and increasing urinary sodium excretion. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are non-peptide competitive inhibitors of AT1. ARBs block the ability of angiotensin II to stimulate pressor and cell proliferative effects. Unlike ACE inhibitors, ARBs do not affect bradykinin-induced vasodilation. The overall effect of ARBs is a decrease in blood pressure.",

O-glucuronidation may also occur. 75% of candesartan is excreted as unchanged drug in urine and feces."

This binding results in displacement of divalent cations and increased membrane permeability, allowing for aminoglycoside entry.[A232294, A232304, A232309, A232314]\r\nThe second \u201cenergy-dependent phase I\u201d of aminoglycoside entry into the cytoplasm relies on the proton-motive force and allows a limited amount of aminoglycoside access to its primary intracellular target - the bacterial 30S ribosome.[A232294, A232314] This ultimately results in the mistranslation of proteins and disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane.[A233320] Finally, in the \u201cenergy-dependent phase II\u201d stage, concentration-dependent bacterial killing is observed. Aminoglycoside rapidly accumulates in the cell due to the damaged cytoplasmic membrane, and protein mistranslation and synthesis inhibition is amplified.[A232294, A232314, A232319] The necessity of oxygen-dependent active transport explains why aminoglycosides are ineffective against anaerobic bacteria.[A234130]\r\nHence, aminoglycosides have both immediate bactericidal effects through membrane disruption and delayed bactericidal effects through impaired protein synthesis; observed experimental data and mathematical modeling support this two-mechanism model.[A232294, A232299]\r\nInhibition of protein synthesis is a key component of aminoglycoside efficacy. Structural and cell biological studies suggest that aminoglycosides bind to the 16S rRNA in helix 44 (h44), near the A site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, altering interactions between h44 and h45. This binding also displaces two important residues, A1492 and A1493, from h44, mimicking normal conformational changes that occur with successful codon-anticodon pairing in the A site.[A232324, A232329] Overall, aminoglycoside binding has several negative effects including inhibition of translation, initiation, elongation, and ribosome recycling.[A232294, A232334, A232339] Recent evidence suggests that the latter effect is due to a cryptic second binding site situated in h69 of the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit.[A232329, A232339] Also, by stabilizing a conformation that mimics correct codon-anticodon pairing, aminoglycosides promote error-prone translation.[A232344] Mistranslated proteins can incorporate into the cell membrane, inducing the damage discussed above.[A232294, A232319]",

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) may suffer from intermittent claudication, exertional leg pain that resolves upon rest, which is underscored by a complex etiology including vascular dysfunction (reduced limb perfusion, angiogenesis, and microcirculatory flow), systemic inflammation, and skeletal muscle dysfunction.[A226410] Pentoxifylline (PTX), (3,7-dimethyl-1-(5-oxohexyl)-3,7-dihydro-1H-purine-2,6-dione) or 1-(5-oxohexyl)-3,7-\u00addimethylxanthine, is a methyl-xanthine derivative that acts to lower blood viscosity by increasing erythrocyte flexibility, reducing plasma fibrinogen, inhibiting neutrophil activation, and suppressing erythrocyte/platelet aggregation; it also has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.[A226415, L30300] Although the precise mechanism of action has yet to be elucidated, numerous studies have suggested several effects of PTX.\r\n\r\nThe classical interpretation of PTX's broad effects is due to its ability to act, _in vitro_, as a non-specific cyclic-3',5'-phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor at millimolar concentrations; specifically, it has been proposed that inhibition of PDE type III and IV isozymes leads to elevated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which mediate diverse downstream effects.[A226420, A226425, A226430] This view has been challenged, specifically by observing those plasma concentrations of PTX in routine clinical use are typically only around 1\u03bcM, far lower than those used to inhibit PDEs _in vitro_.[A226430] Instead, several studies have suggested that PTX can modulate adenosine receptor function, specifically the G\u03b1-coupled A2A receptor (A2AR). Whether PTX acts directly as an A2AR agonist is unclear, although it can clearly increase the response of A2AR to adenosine.[A16840, A16821, A226350, A226435] A2AR activation activates adenylyl cyclase, which increases intracellular cAMP levels; this observation may explain PTX's ability to increase intracellular cAMP in a PDE-independent fashion.[A226440]\r\n\r\nElevated cAMP levels have numerous downstream effects. cAMP-mediated activation of protein kinase A (PKA) suppresses nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB, which suppresses transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and IL-6 as well as TNF-induced molecules such as adhesion molecules (ICAM1 and VCAM1) and the C-reactive protein (CRP).[A226415, A226445, A226450, A226455] PTX has also been shown to prevent the downstream phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK, which are responsible for assembling the NADPH oxidase involved in the neutrophil oxidative burst. This effect is due to a PKA-independent decrease in Akt phosphorylation and a PKA-dependent decrease in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK.[A226450, A226465, A226470] This transcriptional regulation at least partially explains the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties of PTX.\r\n\r\nAlso, activated PKA can activate the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which itself blocks SMAD-driven gene transcription, effectively disrupting transforming growth factor (TGF-\u03b21) signalling.[A226440, A226475] This results in lower levels of fibrinogenic molecules such as collagens, fibronectin, connective tissue growth factor, and alpha-smooth muscle actin.[A226440, A226450, A226475, A226460] Hence, disruption of TGF-\u03b21 signalling may explain the anti-fibrotic effects of PTX, including at least some of the decrease in blood viscosity.\r\n\r\nThe picture is complicated by the observation that PTX metabolites M1, M4, and M5 have been shown to inhibit C5 Des Arg- and formyl-methionylleucylphenylalanine-induced superoxide production in neutrophils and M1 and M5 significantly contribute to PTX's observed hemorheological effects.[A226415, A226430, A226480] Overall, PTX administration is associated with decreased pro-inflammatory molecules, an increase in anti-inflammatory molecules such as IL-10, and decreased production of fibrinogenic and cellular adhesion molecules.",

However, the reaction likely occurs in the liver as well.[A226550, A31221, A226585] PTX is reduced in an NADPH-dependent manner by unknown an unidentified carbonyl reductase to form either [lisofylline] (the (R)-M1 enantiomer) or (S)-M1; the reaction is stereoselective, producing (S)-M1 exclusively in liver cytosol, 85% (S)-M1 in liver microsomes, and a ratio of 0.010-0.025 R:S-M1 after IV or oral dosing in humans.[A31221, A226585] Although both (R)- and (S)-M1 can be oxidized back into PTX, (R)-M1 can also give rise to M2 and M3 in liver microsomes.[A31221, A226585] _In vitro_ studies suggest that CYP1A2 is at least partly responsible for the conversion of [lisofylline] ((R)-M1) back into PTX.[A31220] Unlike the reversible oxidation/reduction of PTX and its M1 metabolites, M4 and M5 are formed via irreversible oxidation of PTX in the liver.[A226545, A226560, A226565, A31221, A226585] Studies in mice recapitulating the PTX-ciprofloxacin drug reaction suggest that CYP1A2 is responsible for the formation of M6 from PTX and of M7 from M1, both through de-methylation at position 7.[A184829] In general, metabolites M2, M3, and M6 are formed at very low levels in mammals.[A226545]"

Contraction of the ciliary muscle via M<sub>3</sub> receptor signalling also leads to accommodation, adjusting the lens for near vision.[A230178] The eye is also innervated by parasympathetic nerves: ciliary ganglion neurons project to the ciliary body and the sphincter pupillae muscle of the iris to control ocular accommodation and pupil constriction.[A230183] \r\n\r\nTropicamide is a non-selective muscarinic antagonist that binds to all subtypes of muscarinic receptors. By binding to muscarinic receptors, tropicamide relaxes the pupillary sphincter muscle and causes pupil dilation.[A229958] By blocking the muscarinic receptors of the ciliary body, tropicamide also prevents accommodation.[A230178] Like other muscarinic antagonists, tropicamide inhibits the parasympathetic drive, allowing the sympathetic nervous system responses to dominate.[A229958] Tropicamide is thought to ameliorate sialorrhea by blocking M<sub>4</sub> receptors expressed on salivary glands and reducing hypersalivation.[A229958]",

Ribavirin is a prodrug that is metabolized into nucleoside analogs that blocks viral RNA synthesis and viral mRNA capping. Before the development of newer drugs, ribavirin and [DB00008]/[DB00022] dual therapy was considered the first-generation and standard antiviral treatment [A19626]. The dual therapy was administered for 48 weeks in patients with genotype 1, 4, 5, and 6, and 24 weeks in patients with genotype 2 and 3 [A19626]. Newer drugs developed as Hepatitis C viral infection treatments can be used to reduce or eliminate the use of ribavirin, which are associated with serious adverse effects. They also improve therapeutic efficacy in patients with failed [DB00008]/[DB00022] and ribavirin-based therapy. The potential use of ribavirin as a treatment for acute myeloid leukemia is currently under investigation.\r\n\r\nAccording to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and 2015 consensus guidelines from the Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver (CASL), ribavirin is typically used as an adjunct therapy to various first-line and second-line combination therapies recommended for each genotypes. Ribavirin is added to decrease relapse rates by accelerating viral clearance early in the treatment course [A19645]. When used to treat Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, it is always used as a part of combination therapies as ribavirin monotherapy is not efficacious in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection [A19644]. Additionally, including ribavirin in the regimen can increase the risk of anemia. \r\n\r\nIn HCV genotye 1/2/3/4/5/6 patients, ribavirin can be used in combination therapy involving [DB09102] and [DB08934], Eplusa ([DB08934], [DB11613]), Harvoni ([DB08934], [DB09027]), [DB06290] and [DB08934], Viekira Pak ([DB09296], [DB09297], [DB00503], [DB09183]), Technivie ([DB00503], [DB09296], [DB09297]) and Zepatier ([DB11574], [DB11575]). Addition of weight-based ribavirin to Technivie therapy increased sustained virologic response after 12 weeks of daily therapy (SVR12) from 90% to 97% in patients with HCV genotype 1a and 90.9% to 100% in HCV genotype 4 patients [L852]. Zepatier therapy along with ribavirin improved SVR in HCV genotype 5 patients. Combination therapy of ribavirin and [DB00008] results in the SVR of 44% in patients with genotype 1 infection and 70% in patients with genotype 2-6. The inclusion of ribavirin in the combination therapies depend on individual patient's profile, for example if HCV genotype 3 patient has a Y93H genetic variant and compensated cirrhosis.",
            "indication": "Indication: Indicated for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in combination with other antiviral agents with the intent to cure or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR). Typically added to improve SVR and reduce relapse rates [A19644].\r\n\r\nThe addition of ribavirin in Technivie therapy indicated for treating HCV genotype 1a and 4 infections is recommended in patients with or without cirrhosis. \r\n\r\nResistance: viral genetic determinants resulting in variable response to ribavirin therapy has not been yet determined. ",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Ribavirin is reported to have several mechanism of actions that lead to inhibition of viral RNA and protein synthesis. \r\nAfter activation by adenosine kinase to ribavirin mono-, di-, and triphosphate metabolites. Ribavirin triphosphate (RTP) is the predominant metabolite which directly inhibits viral mRNA polymerase by binding to the nucleotide binding site of the enzyme. This prevents the binding of the correct nucleotides, leading to a reduction in viral replication or to the production of defective virions [A19645]. RTP also demonstrates an inhibitory action on viral mRNA guanylyltransferase and mRNA 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase of dengue virus. Inhibition of these enzymes disrupts the posttranslational capping of the 5\u2032 end of viral mRNA through ribavirin being incorporated at the 5\u2032 end in place of guanosine and preventing the cap methylation step. \r\n\r\nInhibition of host inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and subsequent depletion of GTP pool is proposed to be another mechanism of action of ribavirin. IMPDH catalyzes the rate-limiting step where inosine 5\u2032-monophosphate is converted to xanthine monophosphate during guanosine monophosphate (GMP) synthesis. GMP is later converted to guanosine triphoshpate (GTP). Ribavirin monophosphate mimics inosine 5\u2032-monophosphate and acts as a competitive inhibitor of IMPDH. Inhibited de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides and decreased intracellular GTP pools leads to a decline in viral protein synthesis and limit replication of viral genomes [A19645].\r\n\r\nRibavirin acts as a mutagen in the target virus to cause an 'error catastrophe' due to increased viral mutations. RTP pairs with cytidine triphosphate or uridine triphosphate with equal efficiency and to block HCV RNA elongation. It causes premature termination of nascent HCV RNA and increases mutagenesis by producing defective virions [A19645].\r\n\r\nRibavirin also exerts an immunomodulatory action of the host to the virus by shifting a Th2 response in favor of a Th1 phenotype. Th2 response and production of type 2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 stimulates the humoral response which enhances immunity toward the virus [A19645]. Ribavirin enhanced induction of interferon-related genes, including the interferon-\u03b1 receptor, and down-regulation of genes involved in interferon inhibition, apoptosis, and hepatic stellate cell activation in vitro [A19644]. ",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Ribavirin mediates direct antiviral activity against a number of DNA and RNA viruses by increasing the mutation frequency in the genomes of several RNA viruses. It is a member of the nucleoside antimetabolite drugs that interfere with duplication of the viral genetic material. The drug inhibits the activity of the enzyme RNA dependent RNA polymerase, due to its resemblence to building blocks of the RNA molecules. ",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: First and as a step required for activation, ribavirin is phosphorylated intracellularly by adenosine kinase to ribavirin mono-, di-, and triphosphate metabolites.

In vitro studies indicate that ribavirin is not a substrate of CYP450 enzymes [L11019]."

[L39095] Patients may experience ED due to a variety of causes including psychogenic, neurogenic, vasculogenic, iatrogenic, or endocrine. [A242392] These causes result in dysfunction of penile smooth muscle relaxation through either disrupted neuronal signaling or direct influence on smooth muscle cells. During sexual arousal, non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) neurons release nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide stimulates guanylate cyclase which converts guanosine triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).[A242287, A242377] cGMP activates the cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG) in a signal cascade which activates K+ channels leading to inhibition of Ca2+ channels, inhibits platelet activation, and inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation while inducing apoptosis. This signal cascade is attenuated by PDE5 which breaks the phosphodiester bond of cGMP, converting it to GMP. Inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil increases signaling via the PKG cascade which supports penile smooth muscle relaxation during sexual arousal by decreasing Ca2+ entry into smooth muscle cells. This smooth muscle relaxation allows blood to fill the corpus cavernosum thereby producing an erection.\r\n\r\nIn PAH, blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries is raised due to a variety of mechanisms stemming from endothelial dysfunction.[A242377] Decreased production of NO and prostacyclin reduce vasodilatory signaling while overproduction of endothelin-1 and thromboxane increase vasoconstriction. Inflammation, thromboses, and hypoxia later contribute to vascular remodeling which further reduces luminal size. The resultant increase in blood pressure reduces the capacity for gas exchange and increases afterload at the right ventricle, producing symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and dizziness as well as leading to right-sided heart failure. Tadalafil exerts its therapeutic effect in PAH through boosting NO-cGMP signaling to contribute to smooth muscle relaxation as with ED.\r\n\r\nLastly, tadalafil is used to treat BPH.[L39095] BPH produces urinary dysfunction through hyperproliferation of the epithelial and smooth muscle layers of the prostate.[A242382] The increased size of the prostate blocks urine flow through the urethra resulting in higher residual volumes due to incomplete emptying. Tadalafil does not appear to exert its benefit via smooth muscle relaxation of the prostate. It may instead exert its effect through a mix of increased oxygenation and decreased inflammation, which decreases tissue remodeling, and inhibition of cell proliferation through the cGMP cascade.\r\n\r\nThe decreased affinity for PDE6 compared to other PDE5 inhibitors may explain the decreased incidence of visual side effects as PDE6 is present in the eye and contributes to color vision.[L39100, L39105, A242287]",

In allergic reactions an allergen interacts with and cross-links surface IgE antibodies on mast cells and basophils. Once the mast cell-antibody-antigen complex is formed, a complex series of events occurs that eventually leads to cell-degranulation and the release of histamine (and other chemical mediators) from the mast cell or basophil. Once released, histamine can react with local or widespread tissues through histamine receptors. Histamine, acting on H<sub>1</sub>-receptors, produces pruritis, vasodilatation, hypotension, flushing, headache, tachycardia, and bronchoconstriction. Histamine also increases vascular permeability and potentiates pain. Brompheniramine is a histamine H1 antagonist (or more correctly, an inverse histamine agonist) of the alkylamine class. It provides effective, temporary relief of sneezing, watery and itchy eyes, and runny nose due to hay fever and other upper respiratory allergies.",

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Flurandrenolide is a topical corticosteroid.  It is normally applied to a plastic tape called Cordran.  Cordran is primarily effective because of its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive actions. Flurandrenolide, which is slowly released from the Cordran tape, binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. Cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In another words, the two main products in inflammation Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding.  Like other glucocorticoid agents Fluocinolone acetonide acts as a physiological antagonist to insulin by decreasing glycogenesis (formation of glycogen).  It also promotes the breakdown of lipids (lipolysis), and proteins, leading to the mobilization of extrahepatic amino acids and ketone bodies. This leads to increased circulating glucose concentrations (in the blood). There is also decreased glycogen formation in the liver.\r\n\r\n",

            "summary": "Refractory anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade III) and Glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV) are primary malignant brain tumours with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Despite considerable genetic heterogeneity, these tumours often have impaired DNA repair systems, rendering them initially sensitive to alkylating agents, although they invariably develop resistance to these agents over time.[A229848, A229858, L32033] Temozolomide is an imidazotetrazine prodrug that is stable at acidic pH but undergoes spontaneous nonenzymatic hydrolysis at neutral or slightly basic pH; these properties allow for both oral and intravenous administration.[A229853, A229888, A229923, L32033] Following initial hydrolysis, further reactions liberate a highly reactive methyl diazonium cation capable of methylating various residues on adenosine and guanine bases leading to DNA lesions and eventual apoptosis.[A229853, A229923] Temozomolide as an adjunct to radiotherapy followed by maintenance dosing remains the standard of care for both Glioblastoma and refractory anaplastic astrocytoma.[L32033]\r\n\r\nTemozolomide was granted FDA approval on August 11, 1999, as an oral capsule and subsequently on February 27, 2009, as an intravenous injection. It is currently marketed under the trademark TEMODAR\u00ae by Merck.[L32033]",
            "indication": "Indication: Temozolomide is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma concomitantly with radiotherapy and for use as maintenance treatment thereafter. It is also indicated for the treatment of refractory anaplastic astrocytoma in adult patients or adjuvant therapy for adults with newly diagnosed anaplastic astrocytoma.[L48265]",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Glioblastoma (glioblastoma multiforme) is the most common and aggressive adult primary brain tumour, accounting for 45.6% of all primary malignant brain tumours. Primarily defined histopathologically by necrosis and microvascular proliferation (WHO grade IV classification), glioblastomas are commonly treated through radiotherapy and concomitant alkylation-based chemotherapy with temozolomide.[A229848] Temozolomide (TMZ) is a small (194 Da) lipophilic alkylating agent of the imidazotetrazine class that is stable at acidic pH, allowing for both oral and intravenous dosing, and can cross the blood-brain barrier to affect CNS tumours.[A229853, A229858, L32033, A229893] After absorption, TMZ undergoes spontaneous nonenzymatic breakdown at physiological pH to form 5-(3-methyltriazen-1-yl) imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC), which then reacts with water to produce 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC) and a highly reactive methyl diazonium cation.[A229853] Brain tumours such as glioblastoma typically possess a more alkaline pH than healthy tissue, favouring TMZ activation within tumour tissue.[A229853]\r\n\r\nThe methyl diazonium cation is highly reactive and methylates DNA at the N7 position of guanine (N7-MeG, 70%), the N3 position of adenine (N3-MeA, 9%), and the O6 position of guanine (O6-MeG, 6%). Although more prevalent, N7-MeG and N3-MeA are rapidly repaired by the base excision repair pathway and are not primary mediators of temozolomide toxicity, although N3-MeA lesions are lethal if not repaired. By comparison, repair of O6-MeG requires action by the suicide enzyme methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), which removes the methyl group to restore guanine. If not repaired by MGMT, O6-MeG mispairs with thymine, activating the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway that removes the thymine (not the O6-MeG), resulting in futile cycles of repair and eventual DNA strand breaks leading to apoptosis.[A229853] As MMR activity is crucial for temozolomide cytotoxicity, cells that have reduced or absent MGMT function and an intact MMR pathway are the most sensitive to temozolomide treatment.[A229853, A229858] Glioblastomas that upregulate MGMT downregulate MMR or alter both are resistant to TMZ, leading to treatment failure.[A229853]\r\n\r\nMore recently, increased interest has also been shown in the immunomodulatory effects of TMZ, related to its myelosuppressive effects. Counterintuitively, lymphodepletion may enhance the antitumour effects of cellular immunotherapy and improve the dynamics of memory cells by altering tumour-specific versus tumour-tolerant populations. The depletion of tumour-localized immunosuppressive T<sub>reg</sub> cells may contribute to an improved response to immunotherapy. Hence, TMZ treatment may also form the backbone of immunotherapy strategies against glioblastoma in the future.[A229873]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Temozolomide is a prodrug of the imidazotetrazine class that requires nonenzymatic hydrolysis at physiological pH _in vivo_ to perform alkylation of adenine/guanine residues, leading to DNA damage through futile repair cycles and eventual cell death. Temozolomide treatment is associated with myelosuppression, which is likely to be more severe in females and geriatric patients. Patients must have an ANC of \u22651.5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L and a platelet count of \u2265100 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L before starting therapy and must be monitored weekly during the concomitant radiotherapy phase, on days one and 22 of maintenance cycles, and weekly at any point where the ANC/platelet count falls below the specified values until recovery. Cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukemia, have been observed following temozolomide administration. Pneumocystis pneumonia may occur in patients undergoing treatment, and prophylaxis should be provided for patients in the concomitant phase of therapy with monitoring at all stages. Severe hepatotoxicity has also been reported, and liver testing should be performed at baseline, midway through the first cycle, before each subsequent cycle, and approximately two to four weeks after the last dose. Animal studies suggest that temozolomide has significant embryo-fetal toxicity; male and female patients should practice contraception up to three and six months following the last dose of temozolomide, respectively.[L32033]",

PDE5 inhibitors, such as vardenafil, inhibit the degradation of cGMP and allow increased blood flow into the penis, resulting in an erection.[A258303,L45563,L45568]. Compared to [sildenafil] and [tadalafil], vardenafil is a more potent inhibitor of PDE5; however, its selectivity for other PDE isoforms is lower than the one detected for tadalafil.[A258318]\r\n\r\nThe FDA approved the use of vardenafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in 2003. Although other PDE5 inhibitors such as [sildenafil] and [tadalafil] have been associated with rare cases of acute liver injury, the use of vardenafil has not been linked to hepatotoxic effects.[A258313] The use of vardenafil as a monotherapy for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension has also been evaluated.[A258308]",

Penile erection during sexual stimulation is caused by increased penile blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penile arteries and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cyclic GMP in smooth muscle cells. Cyclic GMP causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum. The tissue concentration of cyclic GMP is regulated by both the rates of synthesis and degradation via phosphodiesterases (PDEs), and the most abundant PDE in the human corpus cavernosum is PDE5. Therefore, the inhibition of PDE5 by vardenafil enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cyclic GMP.[L45563]",

The presence of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum leads to smooth muscle relaxation, an increased inflow of blood and an erection. Therefore, in patients with erectile dysfunction given vardenafil, normal sexual stimulation will increase cGMP levels in the corpus cavernosum. Without sexual stimulation and no cGMP production, vardenafil should not cause an erection.[L45563,L45568] \r\n\r\nVardenafil should not be used in men for whom sexual activity is not recommended due to their underlying cardiovascular status. There is also a risk of developing prolonged erections that last longer than 4 hours, as well as priapism.

            "summary": "Guaifenesin possesses a storied history, having been originally formally approved by the US FDA in 1952 and continues to be one of very few - if not perhaps the only drug that is readily available and used as an expectorant [F4525]. Since that time the agent has been a combination component of various prescription and non-prescription over-the-counter cough and cold products and is currently a widely available over-the-counter generic medication [F4525]. Although it is principally believed that guaifenesin elicits an action to facilitate productive cough to manage chest congestion [A177661, L6100, F4516, F4522, F4525], it is not known whether the agent can reliably mitigate coughing.\r\n\r\nRegardless, on March 1, 2007, the FDA received a petition asking the FDA to notify the public that some antitussives, expectorants, decongestants, antihistamines, and cough/cold combinations are not known to be safe and effective in children under the age of 6 years [F4525]. After the negotiation between FDA and major manufacturers, a voluntary transition of labels for not using guaifenesin in children under the age of 4 years was endorsed by FDA in 2008 [F4525].\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there has also been contemporary research to suggest that guaifenesin possesses and is capable of demonstrating anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant effects to some degree possibly by acting as an NMDA receptor antagonist [A177652].",
            "indication": "Indication: Guaifenesin is an expectorant that is indicated for providing temporary symptomatic relief from congested chests and coughs which may be due to a cold, bronchitis, and/or other breathing illnesses [FDA Label, F4510, L6079].",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Although the exact mechanism of action of guaifenesin may not yet be formally or totally elucidated, it is believed that expectorants like guaifenesin function by increasing mucus secretion [A177661]. Moreover, it is also further proposed that such expectorants may also act as an irritant to gastric vagal receptors, and recruit efferent parasympathetic reflexes that can elicit glandular exocytosis that is comprised of a less viscous mucus mixture [A177661]. Subsequently, these actions may provoke coughing that can ultimately flush difficult to access, congealed mucopurulent material from obstructed small airways to facilitate a temporary improvement for the individual [A177661].\r\n\r\nConsequently, while it is generally proposed that guaifenesin functions as an expectorant by helping to loosen phlegm (mucus) and thin bronchial secretions to rid the bronchial passageways of bothersome mucus and make coughs more productive, there has also been research to suggest that guaifenesin possesses and is capable of demonstrating anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant effects to some degree possibly by acting as an NMDA receptor antagonist [A177652].",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Guaifenesin is categorized as an expectorant that acts by enhancing the output of phlegm (sputum) and bronchial secretions via decreasing the adhesiveness and surface tension of such material [F4516]. Furthermore, guaifenesin elicits an increased flow of less viscous gastric secretions that subsequently promote ciliary action - all actions that ultimately change dry, unproductive coughing to coughs that are more productive and less frequent [F4516]. Essentially, by decreasing the viscosity and adhesiveness of such secretions, guaifenesin enhances the efficacy of mucociliary activity in removing accumulated secretions from the upper and lower airway [F4516].",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: After the oral administration of 400 mg guaifenesin, the agent experiences rapid hydrolysis (more than 60% of the dose hydrolyzed over a range of seven hours) with \u03b2-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-lactic acid found as the major urinary metabolite but no parent drug detectable in the urine [A177676, L6100]. Moreover, it has been observed that guaifenesin also experiences both oxidation and demethylation [A177676]. In particular, the medication is quickly metabolized hepatically by way of oxidation to \u03b2-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-lactic acid [A177676]. Furthermore, guaifenesin is also demethylated by O-demethylase in liver microsomes to the point where about 40% of an administered dose is excreted as this metabolite in the urine within 3 hours [A177676]. In fact, O-demethylase appears to be the primary enzyme for the metabolism of guaifenesin and the primary metabolites of the substance are \u03b2-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-lactic acid and the demethylated hydroxyguaifenesin, both of which are themselves inactive moieties [A177676]."

It is approved for use in Canada and other countries around the world, but not in the US. It is used for the management of chronic schizophrenia in patients whose main manifestations do not include excitement, agitation or hyperactivity.[L31808] It has been marketed to manage symptoms of depression in patients who may or may not exhibit signs of anxiety.[L31928] In combination with [melitracen], flupentixol is used to manage symptoms of anxiety, depression, and asthenia.[L31923]",

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: The mechanism of action of flupentixol is not completely understood. The antipsychotic actions are mainly thought to arise from cis(Z)-flupentixol, the active stereoisomer, acting as an antagonist at both dopamine D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptors with equal affinities.[A229398] Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by positive (such as hallucinations and delusions) and negative (such as affect flattening and apathy) symptoms. While several neurotransmitter systems are implicated in the pathophysiologic processes leading to the development of symptoms, the dopamine and glutamate systems have been extensively studied. It is generally understood that positive symptoms of schizophrenia arise from a dysregulated striatal dopamine pathway, leading to hyperstimulation of D<sub>2</sub> receptors. Many antipsychotic agents work by blocking D<sub>2</sub> receptors as antagonists;[A229428] similarly, cis(Z)-flupentixol, the active stereoisomer, is an antagonist at D<sub>2</sub> receptors.[A229398] However, there is now evidence that antipsychotic agents can work by blocking other dopamine receptor subtypes, such as D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>3</sub>, or D<sub>4</sub> receptors.[A229413, A229433, A229438] One study showed that cis(Z)-flupentixol is an antagonist at both dopamine D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptors with equal affinities,[A229398] and binds to D3 and D4 receptors with lower affinities. It also binds to alpha-1 adrenoceptors.[A229083] Antidepressant effects of flupentixol are understood to be mediated by antagonism at 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors, which are commonly downregulated following repeated antidepressant treatment.[A177847] Flupentixol also binds to 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors.[A229083] ",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Flupentixol is an antipsychotic agent with anxiolytic and mild sedative actions. It exerts weak anticholinergic and adrenergic effects. It possesses antiemetic actions. As flupentixol works by antagonizing dopamine actions, it can cause extrapyramidal effects,[L31808] mostly at doses greater than 10 mg. In clinical trials, flupentixol-induced extrapyramidal effects have been managed with anti-Parkinsonian drugs.[A229403] Drug esterification in the intramuscular formulation of the drug results in slow release of the drug from the injection site and a prolonged duration of action.[L31808] Flupentixol has been investigated for use in mild to moderate depression: compared to other antidepressant agents, flupentixol has a rapid onset of action, where antidepressive effects were observed within the first two to three days after administration.[A229403]\r\n\r\nAs with other antipsychotic agents, flupentixol can cause QTc prolongation and increase the risk of arrhythmias. In clinical trials, flupentixol was associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular adverse events, stroke, and venous thromboembolism. Flupentixol can elevate the levels of prolactin; however, the clinical significance of hyperprolactinemia caused by neuroleptic drugs is unclear. Long-term hyperprolactinemia, when associated with hypogonadism, may lead to decreased bone mineral density in both female and male subjects.[L31808]\r\n\r\nInterestingly, recent studies show that flupentixol exhibits anti-tumour properties alone or synergistically with other anticancer drugs like gefitinib. One study demonstrated that _in vitro_, flupentixol docks to the ATP binding pocket of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), a lipid kinase that activates signalling pathways that are often hyperactivated in some cancers. Flupentixol inhibited the PI3K/AKT pathway and survival of lung cancer cells _in vitro_ and _in vivo_.[A229408]",

There is also an AT<sub>2</sub> receptor found in many tissues but it is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Eprosartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor. Its affinity for the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor is 1,000 times greater than for the AT<sub>2</sub> receptor. In vitro binding studies indicate that eprosartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor. Eprosartan has also been shown to bind to AT<sub>1</sub> receptors both presynaptically and synaptically. Its action on presynaptic AT<sub>1</sub> receptors results in the inhibition of sympathetically stimulated noradrenaline release.

Eprosartan selectively blocks the binding of angiotensin II to the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor, which in turn leads to multiple effects including vasodilation, a reduction in the secretion of vasopressin, and reduction in the production and secretion of aldosterone. The resulting effect is a decrease in blood pressure.",

FKBP12-sirolimus complex binds to and inhibits the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR),[A1321, L19809] which is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that regulates cell growth, proliferation, survival, mobility, and angiogenesis.[A1320, A1321] mTOR regulates the downstream signalling pathways involved in cell survival, such as the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling pathway.[A1320] Inhibition of mTOR leads to the suppression of cytokine-driven T-cell proliferation, thus the progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle is inhibited. Sirolimus also inhibits antibody production. _In vitro_, sirolimus and other mTOR inhibitors inhibit the production of certain growth factors that may affect angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and vascular permeability.[L19809] \r\n\r\nLymphangioleiomyomatosis is a disorder that primarily affects the lungs. It is characterized by lung tissue infiltration, unregulated alveolar smooth muscle proliferation, and cystic destruction of parenchyma. Although infrequent, it occurs as a symptomatic pulmonary complication in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in TSC genes.[A242437] Loss of functional TSC gene leads to the aberrant activation of the mTOR signalling pathway, resulting in cellular proliferation and release of lymphangiogenic growth factors.

The temporal relationship between the emetogenic action of emetogenic drugs and the release of serotonin, as well as the efficacy of antiemetic agents suggest that chemotherapeutic agents release serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine by causing degenerative changes in the GI tract.

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Ondansetron is a selective antagonist of the serotonin receptor subtype, 5-HT3 [F3178, F3181, F3184].\r\n\r\nCytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy are associated with the release of serotonin (5-HT) from enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine, presumably initiating a vomiting reflex through stimulation of 5-HT3 receptors located on vagal afferents [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Ondansetron may block the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a central release of serotonin from the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Thus, the antiemetic effect of ondansetron is probably due to the selective antagonism of 5-HT3 receptors on neurons located in either the peripheral or central nervous systems, or both [F3178, F3181, F3184].\r\n\r\nAlthough the mechanisms of action of ondansetron in treating postoperative nausea and vomiting and cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting may share similar pathways, the role of ondansetron in opiate-induced emesis has not yet been formally established [F3181, F3184].",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Ondansetron is a highly specific and selective serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, not shown to have activity at other known serotonin receptors and with low affinity for dopamine receptors [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery, and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The temporal relationship between the emetogenic action of emetogenic drugs and the release of serotonin, as well as the efficacy of antiemetic agents, suggest that chemotherapeutic agents release serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine by causing degenerative changes in the GI tract [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The serotonin then stimulates the vagal and splanchnic nerve receptors that project to the medullary vomiting center, as well as the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in the area postrema, thus initiating the vomiting reflex, causing nausea and vomiting [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161].\r\n\r\nMoreover, the effect of ondansetron on the QTc interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo and positive (moxifloxacin) controlled, crossover study in 58 healthy adult men and women [F3181, F3184]. Ondansetron was tested at single doses of 8 mg and 32 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes [F3181, F3184]. At the highest tested dose of 32 mg, prolongation of the Fridericia-corrected QTc interval (QT/RR0.33=QTcF) was observed from 15 min to 4 h after the start of the 15 min infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 19.6 (21.5) msec at 20 min [F3181, F3184]. At the lower tested dose of 8 mg, QTc prolongation was observed from 15 min to 1 h after the start of the 15-minute infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 5.8 (7.8) msec at 15 min [F3181, F3184]. The magnitude of QTc prolongation with ondansetron is expected to be greater if the infusion rate is faster than 15 minutes [F3181, F3184]. The 32 mg intravenous dose of ondansetron must not be administered [F3181, F3184]. No treatment-related effects on the QRS duration or the PR interval were observed at either the 8 or 32 mg dose [F3181, F3184].\r\n\r\nAn ECG assessment study has not been performed for orally administered ondansetron [F3181, F3184]. On the basis of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling, an 8 mg oral dose of ondansetron is predicted to cause a mean QTcF increase of 0.7 ms (90% CI -2.1, 3.3) at steady-state, assuming a mean maximal plasma concentration of 24.7 ng/mL (95% CI 21.1, 29.0) [F3181, F3184]. The magnitude of QTc prolongation at the recommended 5 mg/m2 dose in pediatrics has not been studied, but pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling predicts a mean increase of 6.6 ms (90% CI 2.8, 10.7) at maximal plasma concentrations [F3181, F3184]. \r\n\r\nIn healthy subjects, single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility, gastric motility, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or small intestinal transit time [F3178]. Multiday administration of ondansetron has been shown to slow colonic transit in healthy subjects [F3178]. Ondansetron has no effect on plasma prolactin concentrations [F3178].",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: In vitro metabolism studies have shown that ondansetron is a substrate for human hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 [F3178, F3181, F3184]. In terms of overall ondansetron turnover, CYP3A4 played the predominant role [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Because of the multiplicity of metabolic enzymes capable of metabolizing ondansetron, it is likely that inhibition or loss of one enzyme (e.g. CYP2D6 enzyme deficiency) will be compensated by others and may result in little change in overall rates of ondansetron clearance [F3178, F3181, F3184].\r\n\r\nFollowing oral or IV administration, ondansetron is extensively metabolised and excreted in the urine and faeces [F3178, F3181, F3184]. In humans, less than 10% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine [F3178, F3181, F3184]. The major urinary metabolites are glucuronide conjugates (45%), sulphate conjugates (20%) and hydroxylation products (10%) [F3178, F3181, F3184]. The primary metabolic pathway is subsequently hydroxylation on the indole ring followed by subsequent glucuronide or sulfate conjugation [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Although some nonconjugated metabolites have pharmacologic activity, these are not found in plasma at concentrations likely to significantly contribute to the biological activity of ondansetron [F3178, F3181, F3184]."

A phenomenon known as \u201cquinidine syncope\u201d was first described in the 1950s, characterized by syncopal attacks and ventricular fibrillation in patients treated with this drug.[A38016] Due to its side effects and increased risk of mortality, the use of quinidine was reduced over the next few decades.

            "summary": "Repaglinide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It belongs to the meglitinide class of short-acting insulin secretagogues, which act by binding to \u03b2 cells of the pancreas to stimulate insulin release. Repaglinide induces an early insulin response to meals decreasing postprandial blood glucose levels. It should only be taken with meals and meal-time doses should be skipped with any skipped meal. Approximately one month of therapy is required before a decrease in fasting blood glucose is seen. Meglitnides may have a neutral effect on weight or cause a slight increase in weight. The average weight gain caused by meglitinides appears to be lower than that caused by sulfonylureas and insulin and appears to occur only in those na\u00efve to oral antidiabetic agents. Due to their mechanism of action, meglitinides may cause hypoglycemia although the risk is thought to be lower than that of sulfonylureas since their action is dependent on the presence of glucose. In addition to reducing postprandial and fasting blood glucose, meglitnides have been shown to decrease glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, which are reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control. Meglitinides appear to be more effective at lowering postprandial blood glucose than metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones. Repaglinide is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted in bile. Repaglinide metabolites do not possess appreciable hypoglycemic activity. Approximately 90% of a single orally administered dose is eliminated in feces and 8% in urine.",
            "indication": "Indication: As an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. ",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Repaglinide activity is dependent on the presence functioning &beta; cells and glucose. In contrast to sulfonylurea insulin secretatogogues, repaglinide has no effect on insulin release in the absence of glucose. Rather, it potentiates the effect of extracellular glucose on ATP-sensitive potassium channel and has little effect on insulin levels between meals and overnight. As such, repaglinide is more effective at reducing postprandial blood glucose levels than fasting blood glucose levels and requires a longer duration of therapy (approximately one month) before decreases in fasting blood glucose are observed. The insulinotropic effects of repaglinide are highest at intermediate glucose levels (3 to 10 mmol/L) and it does not increase insulin release already stimulated by high glucose concentrations (greater than 15 mmol/L). Repaglinide appears to be selective for pancreatic &beta; cells and does not appear to affect skeletal or cardiac muscle or thyroid tissue. ",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Insulin secretion by pancreatic &beta; cells is partly controlled by cellular membrane potential. Membrane potential is regulated through an inverse relationship between the activity of cell membrane ATP-sensitive potassium channels (ABCC8) and extracellular glucose concentrations. Extracellular glucose enters the cell via GLUT2 (SLC2A2) transporters. Once inside the cell, glucose is metabolized to produce ATP. High concentrations of ATP inhibit ATP-sensitive potassium channels causing membrane depolarization. When extracellular glucose concentrations are low, ATP-sensitive potassium channels open causing membrane repolarization. High glucose concentrations cause ATP-sensitive potassium channels to close resulting in membrane depolarization and opening of L-type calcium channels. The influx of calcium ions stimulates calcium-dependent exocytosis of insulin granules. Repaglinide increases insulin release by inhibiting ATP-sensitive potassium channels in a glucose-dependent manner. ",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: Repaglinide is rapidly metabolized via oxidation and dealkylation by cytochrome P450 3A4 and 2C9 to form the major dicarboxylic acid derivative (M2). Further oxidation produces the aromatic amine derivative (M1). Glucuronidation of the carboxylic acid group of repaglinide yields an acyl glucuronide (M7). Several other unidentified metabolites have been detected. Repaglinide metabolites to not possess appreciable hypoglycemic activity. "

Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon. Opioids such as anileridine close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP3 and OP1 receptor agonist).

Combination with naloxone is intended to reduce the abuse potential of Suboxone, as naloxone is poorly absorbed by the oral route (and has no effect when taken orally), but would reverse the opioid agonist effects of buprenorphine if injected intravenously.[A186289,L46571] Buprenorphine has poor gastrointestinal absorption and is therefore formulated as a sublingual tablet.\r\n\r\nBuprenorphine has a number of unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that make it a preferred agent for the treatment of conditions requiring high doses of strong opioids.[A186286] For example, buprenorphine dissociates from opioid receptors very slowly, resulting in a long duration of action and relief from pain or withdrawal symptoms for upwards of 24-36 hours. Use of once-daily buprenorphine may benefit individuals who have developed tolerance to other potent opioids and who require larger and more frequent doses. Buprenorphine may also be a preferred agent over [methadone] (which is also commonly used to treat severe pain and opioid use disorder), as it has less effect on Qtc interval prolongation,[A186271,A186274] fewer drug interactions, reduced risk of sexual side effects,[A186298] and an improved safety profile with a lower risk of overdose and respiratory depression.[A186263,A186266,A186269]\r\n\r\nBuprenorphine acts as a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist with a high affinity for the receptor, but lower intrinsic activity compared to other full mu-opioid agonists such as [heroin], [oxycodone], or [methadone].[A186292] This means that buprenorphine preferentially binds the opioid receptor and displaces lower affinity opioids without activating the receptor to a comparable degree. Clinically, this results in a slow onset of action and a clinical phenomenon known as the \"ceiling effect\" where once a certain dose is reached, buprenorphine's effects plateau. This effect can be beneficial, however, as dose-related side effects such as respiratory depression, sedation, and intoxication also plateau at around 32mg, resulting in a lower risk of overdose compared to [methadone] and other full agonist opioids.[A186215,A186218] It also means that opioid-dependent patients do not experience sedation or euphoria at the same rate that they might experience with more potent opioids, improving quality of life for patients with severe pain and reducing the reinforcing effects of opioids which can lead to drug-seeking behaviours.[A186280]\r\n\r\nTreatment of opioid addiction with buprenorphine, [methadone], or slow-release oral [morphine] (SROM) is termed Opioid Agonist Treatment (OAT) or Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST). The intention of substitution of illicit opioids with the long-acting opioids used in OAT is to prevent withdrawal symptomns for 24-36 hours following dosing to ultimately reduce cravings and drug-seeking behaviours. Use of OAT is also intended to improved social stabilization including a reduction in crime rates, marginalization, incarceration, and use of illicit substances such as [heroin] or [fentanyl].

It demonstrates a high affinity for the mu-opioid receptor but has lower intrinsic activity compared to other full mu-opioid agonists such as [heroin], [oxycodone], or [methadone].[A186292] This means that buprenorphine preferentially binds the opioid receptor and displaces lower affinity opioids without activating the receptor to a comparable degree. Clinically, this results in a slow onset of action and a clinical phenomenon known as the \"ceiling effect\" where once a certain dose is reached buprenorphine's effects plateau. This effect can be beneficial, however, as dose-related side effects such as respiratory depression, sedation, and intoxication also plateau at around 32mg, resulting in a lower risk of overdose compared to [methadone] and other full agonist opioids.[A186215,A186218] It also means that opioid-dependent patients do not experience sedation or euphoria at the same rate that they might experience with more potent opioids, improving quality of life for patients with severe pain and reducing the reinforcing effects of opioids which can lead to drug-seeking behaviours.[A186280]\r\n\r\nBuprenorphine's high affinity, but low intrinsic activity for the mu-opioid receptor also means that if it is started in opioid-dependent individuals, it will displace the other opioids without creating an equal opioid effect and cause a phenomenon known as \"precipitated withdrawal\" which is characterized by a rapid and intense onset of withdrawal symptoms (i.e. anxiety, restlessness, gastrointestinal distress, diaphoresis, intense drug cravings, and tachycardia). Individuals must therefore be in a state of mild to moderate withdrawal before starting therapy with buprenorphine. \r\n\r\nBuprenorphine is commercially available as the brand name product Suboxone which is formulated in a 4:1 fixed-dose combination product along with [naloxone], a non-selective competitive opioid receptor antagonist. Combination of an opioid agonist with an opioid antagonist may seem counterintuitive, however this combination with naloxone is intended to reduce the abuse potential of Suboxone, as naloxone is poorly absorbed by the oral route (and has no effect when taken orally), but would reverse the opioid agonist effects of buprenorphine if injected intravenously.[A186289,L46571] ",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Buprenorphine interacts predominately with the opioid mu-receptor. These mu-binding sites are discretely distributed in the human brain, spinal cord, and other tissues. In clinical settings, buprenorphine exerts its principal pharmacologic effects on the central nervous system. Its primary actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. In addition to analgesia, alterations in mood, euphoria and dysphoria, and drowsiness commonly occur. Buprenorphine depresses the respiratory centers, depresses the cough reflex, and constricts the pupils. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Dependence**\r\n\r\nBuprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and chronic administration produces physical dependence of the opioid type, characterized by withdrawal signs and symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation or rapid taper. The withdrawal syndrome is typically milder than seen with full agonists and may be delayed in onset. Buprenorphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing buprenorphine in situations when the clinician is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion.[F4718]\r\n\r\n\r\n**Withdrawal**\r\n\r\nAbrupt discontinuation of treatment is not recommended as it may result in an opioid withdrawal syndrome that may be delayed in onset. Signs and symptoms may include body aches, diarrhea, gooseflesh, loss of appetite, nausea, nervousness or restlessness, anxiety, runny nose, sneezing, tremors or shivering, stomach cramps, tachycardia, trouble with sleeping, unusual increase in sweating, palpitations, unexplained fever, weakness and yawning.[F4718]\r\n\r\n\r\n**Risk of Respiratory and Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression and Overdose**\r\n\r\nBuprenorphine has been associated with life-threatening respiratory depression and death. Many, but not all, post-marketing reports regarding coma and death involved misuse by self-injection or were associated with the concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressant, including alcohol. Use buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression).[L46571]\r\n\r\n\r\n**Risk of Overdose in Opioid Na\u00efve Patients**\r\n\r\nThere have been reported deaths of opioid-na\u00efve individuals who received a 2 mg dose of buprenorphine as a sublingual tablet for analgesia. Buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets are not appropriate as an analgesic in opioid-na\u00efve patients.[L46571]\r\n\r\n\r\n**Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms**\r\n\r\nIf buprenorphine is started in opioid-dependent individuals, it will displace the other opioids and cause a phenomenon known as \"precipitated withdrawal\" which is characterized by a rapid and intense onset of withdrawal symptoms. Individuals must therefore be in a state of mild to moderate withdrawal before starting therapy with buprenorphine. \r\n\r\nBecause it contains naloxone, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets are also highly likely to produce marked and intense withdrawal signs and symptoms if misused parenterally by individuals dependent on full opioid agonists such as heroin, morphine, or methadone.[L46571]\r\n\r\n\r\n**Gastrointestinal Effects**\r\n\r\nBuprenorphine and other morphine-like opioids have been shown to decrease bowel motility and cause constipation. Buprenorphine may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions and should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract.[L46571]\r\n\r\n\r\n**Effects on the Endocrine System**\r\n\r\nOpioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date. Patients presenting with symptoms of androgen deficiency should undergo laboratory evaluation.[L46571]\r\n\r\n\r\n**Adrenal Insufficiency**\r\n\r\nCases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.[L46571]\r\n\r\n\r\n**Use in Patients With Impaired Hepatic Function**\r\n\r\nBuprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The doses of buprenorphine and naloxone in this fixed-dose combination product cannot be individually titrated, and hepatic impairment results in a reduced clearance of naloxone to a much greater extent than buprenorphine. Therefore, patients with severe hepatic impairment will be exposed to substantially higher levels of naloxone than patients with normal hepatic function. This may result in an increased risk of precipitated withdrawal at the beginning of treatment (induction) and may interfere with buprenorphine\u2019s efficacy throughout treatment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the differential reduction of naloxone clearance compared to buprenorphine clearance is not as great as in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. However, buprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended for initiation of (treatment induction) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment due to the increased risk of precipitated withdrawal. Buprenorphine/naloxone products may be used with caution for maintenance treatment in patients with moderate hepatic impairment who have initiated treatment on a buprenorphine product without naloxone. However, patients should be carefully monitored and consideration given to the possibility of naloxone interfering with buprenorphine\u2019s efficacy.[L46571]\r\n\r\n\r\n**Risk of Hepatitis, Hepatic Events**\r\n\r\nCases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving buprenorphine in clinical trials and through post-marketing adverse event reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of death, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. In many cases, the presence of pre-existing liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and ongoing injecting drug use may have played a causative or contributory role. In other cases, insufficient data were available to determine the etiology of the abnormality. Withdrawal of buprenorphine has resulted in amelioration of acute hepatitis in some cases; however, in other cases no dose reduction was necessary. The possibility exists that buprenorphine had a causative or contributory role in the development of the hepatic abnormality in some cases. Liver function tests, prior to initiation of treatment is recommended to establish a baseline. Periodic monitoring of liver function during treatment is also recommended. A biological and etiological evaluation is recommended when a hepatic event is suspected. Depending on the case, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets may need to be carefully discontinued to prevent withdrawal signs and symptoms and a return by the patient to illicit drug use, and strict monitoring of the patient should be initiated.[L46571]\r\n\r\n\r\n**Orthostatic Hypotension**\r\n\r\nLike other opioids, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Elevation of Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure**\r\n\r\nBuprenorphine, like other opioids, may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure and should be used with caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, and other circumstances when cerebrospinal pressure may be increased. Buprenorphine can produce miosis and changes in the level of consciousness that may interfere with patient evaluation.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Elevation of Intracholedochal Pressure**\r\n\r\nBuprenorphine has been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, as do other opioids, and thus should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract.",

Calcium concentration and, therefore, sensitization decline during diastole, allowing normal or improved diastolic relaxation. Levosimendan also leads to vasodilation through the opening of ATP-sensitive potassium channels. By these inotropic and vasodilatory actions, levosimendan increases cardiac output without increasing myocardial oxygen demand.

Action on the brainstem is thought to result in diminished activity of efferent alpha and gamma motor neurons, likely mediated by inhibition of coeruleus-spinal or reticulospinal pathways, and ultimately depressed spinal cord interneuron activity.[A184982]\r\n\r\nMore recently it has been suggested that inhibition of descending serotonergic pathways in the spinal cord via action on 5-HT2 receptors may contribute to cyclobenzaprine\u2019s observed effects.[A5896,A184982,A4862]",

It differs from cytosine by the presence of nitrogen in the C5-position, key in its hypomethylating activity.[A1406,A1413,A1415] Two main mechanisms of action have been proposed for azacitidine. One of them is the induction of cytotoxicity. As an analogue of cytidine, it is able to incorporate into RNA and DNA, disrupting RNA metabolism and inhibiting protein and DNA synthesis. The other one is through the inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, impairing DNA methylation.[A1407] Due to its anti-neoplastic activity and its ability to inhibit methylation in replicating DNA, azacytidine has been used mainly used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), two types of cancer characterized by the presence of aberrant DNA methylation.[A1407,A1410,A1411,A1416,A1417]\r\n\r\nIn May 2004, the FDA approved the use of azacitidine administered subcutaneously for the treatment of MDS of all French-American-British (FAB) subtypes.

Afterwards, pyrimidine monophosphate and diphosphate kinases phosphorylate 5-azacytidine monophosphate to form 5-azacytidine diphosphate and triphosphate, respectively. Azacitidine triphosphate is able to incorporate into RNA, disrupting RNA metabolism and protein synthesis. The reduction of azacytidine diphosphate leads to the formation of 5-aza-deoxycytidine diphosphate, which is then phosphorylated to form 5-azadeoxycitidine triphosphate, a compound able to incorporate into DNA and inhibit DNA synthesis.[A1407]\r\n\r\nAs a ribonucleoside, azacitidine incorporates into RNA to a larger extent than into DNA. Incorporating into RNA leads to the disassembly of polyribosomes, defective methylation and acceptor function of transfer RNA, and the inhibition of protein production, resulting in cell death. During the S-phase of the cell cycle, azacitidine exhibits the highest toxicity; however, the predominant mechanism of cytotoxicity has not been elucidated.[A1407]\r\n\r\nThe cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms.

It is also used for symptomatic pain relief after surgical and dental procedures [FDA label]. \r\n\r\nThe _extra strength_ formulation of acetylsalicylic acid is also indicated for the management migraine pain with photophobia (sensitivity to light) and phonophobia (sensitivity to sound)[FDA label].\r\n\r\n**Other indications**\r\n\r\nASA is also indicated for various other purposes, due to its ability to inhibit platelet aggregation. These include: \r\n\r\nReducing the risk of cardiovascular death in suspected cases of myocardial infarction (MI) [FDA label]. \r\n\r\nReducing the risk of a first non-fatal myocardial infarction in patients, and for reducing the risk of morbidity and mortality in cases of unstable angina and in those who have had a prior myocardial infarction [FDA label].\r\n\r\nFor reducing the risk of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and to prevent atherothrombotic cerebral infarction (in conjunction with other treatments) [FDA label].\r\n\r\nFor the prevention of thromboembolism after hip replacement surgery [FDA label]. \r\n\r\nFor decreasing platelet to platelet adhesion following carotid endarterectomy, aiding in the prevention of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) [FDA label].\r\n\r\nUsed for patients undergoing hemodialysis with a silicone rubber arteriovenous cannula inserted to prevent thrombosis at the insertion site [FDA Label]. \r\n\r\n**Important note regarding use of the extended-release formulation [F4405]**\r\n\r\nIn the setting of acute myocardial infarction, or before percutaneous interventions, the extended-release form of acetylsalicylic acid should not be used. Use immediate-release formulations in scenarios requiring rapid onset of action [Label, F4405]. The extended-release form is taken to decrease the incidence of mortality and myocardial infarction (MI) for individuals diagnosed with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD), including patients with previous myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina or with chronic stable angina. Additionally, the extended-release form is used to decrease the risk of death and recurrent episodes of stroke in patients with a history of stroke or TIA [F4405].\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) blocks prostaglandin synthesis. It is non-selective for COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes [A177241, A10989, A32682]. Inhibition of COX-1 results in the inhibition of platelet aggregation for about 7-10 days (average platelet lifespan). The acetyl group of acetylsalicylic acid binds with a serine residue of the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzyme, leading to irreversible inhibition. This prevents the production of pain-causing prostaglandins. This process also stops the conversion of arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which is a potent inducer of platelet aggregation [FDA label].  Platelet aggregation can result in clots and harmful venous and arterial thromboembolism, leading to conditions such as pulmonary embolism and stroke. \r\n\r\nIt is important to note that there is 60% homology between the protein structures of COX-1 and COX-2. ASA binds to serine 516 residue on the active site of COX-2 in the same fashion as its binding to the serine 530 residue located on the active site of COX-1. The active site of COX-2 is, however, slightly larger than the active site of COX-1, so that arachidonic acid (which later becomes prostaglandins) manages to bypass the aspirin molecule inactivating COX-2 [A32682, A177256].  ASA, therefore, exerts more action on the COX-1 receptor rather than on the COX-2 receptor [A177268]. A higher dose of acetylsalicylic acid is required for COX-2 inhibition [A177325]. ",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: **Effects on pain and fever**\r\n\r\nAcetylsalicylic acid disrupts the production of prostaglandins throughout the body by targeting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [A177241, A10989, A32682]. Prostaglandins are potent, irritating substances that have been shown to cause headaches and pain upon injection into humans.  Prostaglandins increase the sensitivity of pain receptors and substances such as histamine and bradykinin. Through the disruption of the production and prevention of release of prostaglandins in inflammation, this drug may stop their action at pain receptors, preventing symptoms of pain. Acetylsalicylic acid is considered an antipyretic agent because of its ability to interfere with the production of brain prostaglandin E1. Prostaglandin E1 is known to be an extremely powerful fever-inducing agent [FDA label]. \r\n\r\n**Effects on platelet aggregation**\r\n\r\nThe inhibition of platelet aggregation by ASA occurs because of its interference with thromboxane A2 in platelets, caused by COX-1 inhibition. Thromboxane A2 is an important lipid responsible for platelet aggregation, which can lead to clot formation and future risk of heart attack or stroke  [FDA label]. \r\n\r\n**A note on cancer prevention**\r\n\r\nASA has been studied in recent years to determine its effect on the prevention of various malignancies [A177325]. In general, acetylsalicylic acid is involved in the interference of various cancer signaling pathways, sometimes inducing or upregulating tumor suppressor genes [A177325, A177403]. Results of various studies suggest that there are beneficial effects of long-term ASA use in the prevention of several types of cancer, including stomach, colorectal, pancreatic, and liver cancers [A177400].

Salicylic acid was measured at 24 hours following a single dose of extended-release acetylsalicylic acid [F4405].\r\n\r\nSalicylate is mainly metabolized in the liver, although other tissues may also be involved in this process [FDA label]. The major metabolites of acetylsalicylic acid are salicylic acid, salicyluric acid, the ether or phenolic glucuronide and the ester or acyl glucuronide. A small portion is converted to gentisic acid and other hydroxybenzoic acids [FDA label].\r\n\r\n"

The synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and anticoagulant proteins C and S is inhibited. Depression of three of the four vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (factors II, VII, and X) results in decreased prothrombin levels and a decrease in the amount of thrombin generated and bound to fibrin.

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: There are several physiological and molecular processes implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine. Vasodilation of intracranial extracerebral blood vessels, particularly those supplying the dura mater, has been associated with migraine pain.[A1460, A258928] Activation of the trigeminovascular system leads to the release of vasoactive neuropeptides (such as substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and neurokinin A) from the trigeminal nerve innervating the intracranial vessels and dura mater. Vasoactive neuropeptides cause perivascular inflammation and vasodilation in the periphery. Migraine-associated nausea and vomiting are thought to arise from the activation of central and nociceptive sensory neurons that project to autonomic brain-stem nuclei and higher subcortical and cortical pain processing centres.[A1460] An imbalance in serotonin (5-HT) levels has also been documented: 5-HT binds to 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors to promote trigeminal neuronal firing and vasoconstriction.[A1460, A258968]\r\n\r\nRizatriptan is a selective agonist at the 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system. It binds to these receptors with high affinity.[L46018] The exact mechanism of action of rizatriptan has not been fully elucidated; however, several documented pharmacological actions of rizatriptan may contribute to its antimigraine effects. Rizatriptan causes vasoconstriction of intracranial extracerebral blood vessels, which is thought to occur primarily via 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptors. Rizatriptan also inhibits nociceptive neurotransmission in trigeminal pain pathways. It attenuates the release of vasoactive neuropeptides by the trigeminal nerve, which is thought to occur via neurogenic and central 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors.[A1460, A258918, A258928] Rizatriptan inhibited neurogenic dural vasodilation and plasma protein extravasation in animal studies.[A1460, A5971, A258918, A258928]",

Methyldopa works by binding to alpha(\u03b1)-2 adrenergic receptors as an agonist, leading to the inhibition of adrenergic neuronal outflow and reduction of vasoconstrictor adrenergic signals.[A1499] Methyldopa exists in two isomers D-\u03b1-methyldopa and L-\u03b1-methyldopa, which is the active form.[A232224]\r\n\r\nFirst introduced in 1960 as an antihypertensive agent, methyldopa was considered to be useful in certain patient populations, such as pregnant women and patients with renal insufficiency.

The sympathetic outflow is regulated by alpha (\u03b1)-2 adrenergic receptors and imidazoline receptors expressed on adrenergic neurons within the rostral ventrolateral medulla.[A1501] Methyldopa is metabolized to \u03b1\u2010methylnorepinephrine via dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity and, consequently, alpha-methylepinephrine via phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase activity.[A232244, A232249, A232259] Mediating the therapeutic effects of methyldopa, \u03b1\u2010methylnorepinephrine and \u03b1-methylepinephrine active metabolites are agonists at presynaptic alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the brainstem. Stimulating alpha-2 adrenergic receptors results in the inhibition of adrenergic neuronal outflow and attenuation of norepinephrine release in the brainstem. Consequently, the output of vasoconstrictor adrenergic signals to the peripheral sympathetic nervous system is reduced, leading to a reduction in blood pressure.[A1499]\r\n\r\nThe L-isomer of alpha-methyldopa also reduces blood pressure by inhibiting aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, also known as DOPA decarboxylase, which is an enzyme responsible for the syntheses of dopamine and serotonin.[L32614] Inhibiting this enzyme leads to depletion of biogenic amines such as norepinephrine. However, inhibition of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase plays a minimal role in the blood-pressure\u2010lowering effect of methyldopa.[A1501, A1505]",

Overall, methyldopa lowers both standing blood pressure and especially supine blood pressure, with infrequent symptomatic postural hypotension. Methyldopa also reduces plasma renin activity but has negligible effects on glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, or filtration fraction. It also has no direct effect on cardiac function but in some patients, a slowed heart rate may occur.[L32614]\r\n\r\nFollowing oral administration, blood-pressure-lowering effects are observed within 12 to 24 hours in most patients, and a maximum reduction in blood pressure occurs in 4 to 6 hours.

The discovery and research of this drug began in the early 1990s, after the intravenous administration of radiolabelled ezetimibe in rats revealed that it was being localized within enterocytes of the intestinal villi - this prompted studies investigating the effect of ezetimibe on intestinal cholesterol absorption.[A15202] Ezetimibe is used as an adjunctive therapy to a healthy diet to lower cholesterol levels in primary hyperlipidemia, mixed hyperlipidemia, homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), and homozygous sitosterolemia (phytosterolemia).[L11347]\r\n\r\nUnlike other classes of cholesterol-reducing compounds including statins and bile acid sequestrants, ezetimibe has a distinct mechanism of action involving the sterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), and is unique in that it does not affect the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients such as fat-soluble vitamins, triglycerides, or bile acids.[A33313] In genetically NPC1L1-deficient mice, a 70% reduction in intestinal cholesterol absorption was seen, and these mice were insensitive to ezetimibe treatment - it was determined based on these findings that NPC1L1 plays an essential role in promoting intestinal cholesterol uptake via an ezetimibe-sensitive pathway.[A15202] By interfering with the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols, ezetimibe reduces the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver.[L11347]",
            "indication": "Indication: Ezetimibe is indicated to reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia, alone or in combination with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin).[L11347,L11401,L11404] It is also indicated to reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia in combination with fenofibrate, and to reduce elevated total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), in combination with atorvastatin or simvastatin.[L11347] Ezetimibe may also be used to reduce elevated sitosterol and campesterol in patients with homozygous sitosterolemia (phytosterolemia).[L11347]",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Ezetimibe mediates its blood cholesterol-lowering effect via selectively inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol and phytosterol by the small intestine without altering the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and nutrients.[A15202] The primary target of ezetimibe is the cholesterol transport protein Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein. NPC1L1 is expressed on enterocytes/gut lumen (apical) as well as the hepatobiliary (canalicular) interface and plays a role in facilitating internalization of free cholesterol into the enterocyte in conjunction with the adaptor protein 2 (AP2) complex and clathrin.[A33309] Once cholesterol in the gut lumen or bile is incorporated into the cell membrane of enterocytes, it binds to the sterol-sensing domain of NPC1L1 and forms a NPC1L1/cholesterol complex. The complex is then internalized or endocytosed by joining to AP2 clathrin, forming a vesicle complex that is translocated for storage in the endocytic recycling compartment.[A33309]\r\n\r\nEzetimibe does not require exocrine pancreatic function for its pharmacological activity; rather, it localizes and appears to act at the brush border of the small intestine. Ezetimibe selectively blocks the NPC1L1 protein in the jejunal brush border, reducing the uptake of intestinal lumen micelles into the enterocyte.[A33309] Overall, ezetimibe causes a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver and reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and an increase in clearance of cholesterol from the blood. While the full mechanism of action of ezetimibe in reducing the entry of cholesterol into both enterocytes and hepatocytes is not fully understood, one study proposed that ezetimibe prevents the NPC1L1/sterol complex from interacting with AP2 in clathrin coated vesicles and induces a conformational change in NPC1L1, rendering it incapable of binding to sterols.[A33309] Another study suggested that ezetimibe disrupts the function of other protein complexes involved in regulating cholesterol uptake, including the CAV1\u2013annexin 2 heterocomplex.[A33309]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Ezetimibe was shown to reduce the levels of total cholesterol (total-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apoprotein B (Apo B), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG), and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with hyperlipidemia.[L11347] This therapeutic effect was more profound when ezetimibe was co-administered with a statin or fenofibrate compared to either treatment alone.[L11347] In clinical trials involving patients with homozygous and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and in those with sitosterolemia, a recommended therapeutic dose of ezetimibe was effective in reducing the LDL levels by 15-20% while increasing HDL-C by 2.5-5%.[A33313]\r\n\r\nThe effects of increased exposure to ezetimibe secondary to moderate-severe hepatic impairment have not been assessed - patients meeting these criteria should avoid the use of ezetimibe.[L11347] Post-marketing reports indicate the potential for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis in patients taking ezetimibe, and this risk appears to be exacerbated in patients concurrently receiving, or having recently received, statin therapy.[L11347] ",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: In humans, ezetimibe is rapidly and extensively metabolized via a phase II glucuronide conjugation reaction in the small intestine and liver to form its main phenolic metabolite, ezetimibe glucuronide. The main human liver and/or intestinal uridine 5\u2032-diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes responsible for the glucuronidation of ezetimibe were shown to be UGT1A1, 1A3, and 2B15 _in vitro_.[A15202] Minimal phase I reaction involving oxidation of ezetimibe also occurs to form SCH 57871, and human jejunum microsomes also produced trace levels of a benzylic glucuronide (SCH 488128).[A15202] Ezetimibe glucuronide accounts for 80-90% of the total circulating compound in plasma, and retains some pharmacological activity in inhibiting intestinal cholesterol uptake.[L11347] In humans, ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide constitutes approximately 93% of the total drug in plasma.[L11347] Plasma concentration-time profiles exhibit multiple peaks, suggestive of enterohepatic recycling[L11347], and about 20% of the drug distributed is reabsorbed due to enterohepatic recirculation.[F133]"

The amounts of manganese and iron metabolized are not significant.

Compared to erythromycin A, telithromycin binds to the 23S rRNA with 10 times greater affinity in erythromycin-susceptible organisms and 25 times greater affinity in macrolide-resistant strains.

Salbutamol is formulated as a racemic mixture of the R- and S-isomers. The R-isomer has 150 times greater affinity for the beta2-receptor than the S-isomer and the S-isomer has been associated with toxicity. This lead to the development of levalbuterol, the single R-isomer of salbutamol. However, the high cost of levalbuterol compared to salbutamol has deterred wide-spread use of this enantiomerically pure version of the drug. Salbutamol is generally used for acute episodes of bronchospasm caused by bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis and other chronic bronchopulmonary disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD).

These carbonium ions alkylate DNA, which results in the interference of DNA replication and RNA transcription, ultimately leading to the disruption of nucleic acid function. Specifically, its mechanism of action through alkylation produces guanine-adenine intrastrand crosslinks. These crosslinks occur through a SN2 reaction guanine N7 nucleophilically attacks the carbon adjacent to the mesylate leaving group. This kind of damage cannot be repaired by cellular machinery and thus the cell undergoes apoptosis.",

Alkylating agents are so named because of their ability to add alkyl groups to many electronegative groups under conditions present in cells. They stop tumor growth by cross-linking guanine bases in DNA double-helix strands - directly attacking DNA. This makes the strands unable to uncoil and separate. As this is necessary in DNA replication, the cells can no longer divide. In addition, these drugs add methyl or other alkyl groups onto molecules where they do not belong which in turn leads to a miscoding of DNA. Alkylating agents are cell cycle-nonspecific and work by three different mechanisms, all of which achieve the same end result - disruption of DNA function and cell death.

            "summary": "Felodipine is a long-acting 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB)b. It acts primarily on vascular smooth muscle cells by stabilizing voltage-gated L-type calcium channels in their inactive conformation. By inhibiting the influx of calcium in smooth muscle cells, felodipine prevents calcium-dependent myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. Felodipine is the most potent CCB in use and is unique in that it exhibits fluorescent activity. In addition to binding to L-type calcium channels, felodipine binds to a number of calcium-binding proteins, exhibits competitive antagonism of the mineralcorticoid receptor, inhibits the activity of calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, and blocks calcium influx through voltage-gated T-type calcium channels. Felodipine is used to treat mild to moderate essential hypertension.",
            "indication": "Indication: For the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension. ",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Felodipine decreases arterial smooth muscle contractility and subsequent vasoconstriction by inhibiting the influx of calcium ions through voltage-gated L-type calcium channels. It reversibly competes against nitrendipine and other DHP CCBs for DHP binding sites in vascular smooth muscle and cultured rabbit atrial cells. Calcium ions entering the cell through these channels bind to calmodulin. Calcium-bound calmodulin then binds to and activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Activated MLCK catalyzes the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain subunit of myosin, a key step in muscle contraction. Signal amplification is achieved by calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors. Inhibition of the initial influx of calcium decreases the contractile activity of arterial smooth muscle cells and results in vasodilation. The vasodilatory effects of felodipine result in an overall decrease in blood pressure. Felodipine may be used to treat mild to moderate essential hypertension.",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Felodipine belongs to the dihydropyridine (DHP) class of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), the most widely used class of CCBs. There are at least five different types of calcium channels in Homo sapiens: L-, N-, P/Q-, R- and T-type. It was widely accepted that CCBs target L-type calcium channels, the major channel in muscle cells that mediates contraction; however, some studies have shown that felodipine also binds to and inhibits T-type calcium channels. T-type calcium channels are most commonly found on neurons, cells with pacemaker activity and on osteocytes. The pharmacologic significance of T-type calcium channel blockade is unknown. Felodipine also binds to calmodulin and inhibits calmodulin-dependent calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The effect of this interaction appears to be minor.  Another study demonstrated that felodipine attenuates the activity of calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CaMPDE) by binding to the PDE-1B1 and PDE-1A2 enzyme subunits. CaMPDE is one of the key enzymes involved in cyclic nucleotides and calcium second messenger systems. Felodipine also acts as an antagonist to the mineralcorticoid receptor by competing with aldosterone for binding and blocking aldosterone-induced coactivator recruitment of the mineralcorticoid receptor. Felodipine is able to bind to skeletal and cardiac muscle isoforms of troponin C, one of the key regulatory proteins in muscle contraction. Though felodipine exhibits binding to many endogenous molecules, its vasodilatory effects are still thought to be brought about primarily through inhibition of voltage-gated L-type calcium channels. Similar to other DHP CCBs, felodipine binds directly to inactive calcium channels stabilizing their inactive conformation. Since arterial smooth muscle depolarizations are longer in duration than cardiac muscle depolarizations, inactive channels are more prevalent in smooth muscle cells. Alternative splicing of the alpha-1 subunit of the channel gives felodipine additional arterial selectivity. At therapeutic sub-toxic concentrations, felodipine has little effect on cardiac myocytes and conduction cells.",

The 3'-DNA terminus of the broken DNA strand binds covalently with the topoisomerase enzyme to form a catalytic intermediate called a cleavable complex. After DNA is sufficiently relaxed and the strand passage reaction is complete, DNA topoisomerase reattaches the broken DNA strands to form the unaltered topoisomers that allow transcription to proceed. Topotecan interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal cells can be affected by the medicine, other effects may also occur.

These 2 transcription factors are vital for the proliferation and survival of malignant myeloma cells. [A246125] \r\n\r\nRegarding TNF-alpha, thalidomide seems to block this mediator via a variety of mechanism.

Additionally, thalidomide prevents the activation of Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-kB), another upstream effector of the TNF-alpha production pathway. Finally, some evidences suggest that thalidomide can block alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP), a known inducer of the NF-kB/MyD88 pathway, thus inhibiting the expression of TNF-alpha [A246195].

Activation of ClC-2 chloride channels causes an efflux of chloride ions into the lumen, which in turn leads to an efflux of sodium ions through a paracellular pathway to maintain isoelectric neutrality. As a result, water follows sodium into the lumen in order to maintain isotonic equilibrium, thereby increasing intestinal fluid secretion.

Activation of ClC-2 chloride channels may also stimulate the recovery of muscosal barrier function by restoring tight junction protein complexes in the intestine.

It is a very common over-the-counter medication widely used as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic.[A39096]\r\n\r\nThe use of ibuprofen and its enantiomer [DB09213] in a racemic mix is common for the management of mild to moderate pain related to dysmenorrhea, headache, migraine, postoperative dental pain, spondylitis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and soft tissue disorder.[A39097]\r\n\r\nDue to its activity against prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis, ibuprofen has been attributed to alteration of platelet function and prolongation of gestation and labour.[A39092]\r\n\r\nAs ibuprofen is a widely used medication, the main therapeutic indications are:\r\n\r\n* Patent Ductus Arteriosus - it is a neonatal condition wherein the ductus arteriosus (blood vessel that connects the main pulmonary artery to the proximal descending aorta) fails to close after birth causing severe risk of heart failure. The prostaglandin inhibition of ibuprofen has been studied for the treatment of this condition as it is known that prostaglandin E2 is responsible for keeping the ductus arteriosus open.[A39100]\r\n\r\n* Rheumatoid- and osteo-arthritis - ibuprofen is very commonly used in the symptomatic treatment of inflammatory, musculoskeletal and rheumatic disorders.[A39176]\r\n\r\n* Cystic fibrosis - the use of high dosages of ibuprofen has been proven to decrease inflammation and decreasing polymorphonuclear cell influx in the lungs.[A39177]\r\n\r\n* Orthostatic hypotension - ibuprofen can induce sodium retention and antagonize the effect of diuretics which has been reported to be beneficial for patients with severe orthostatic hypotension.[A1651]\r\n\r\n* Dental pain - ibuprofen is used to manage acute and chronic orofacial pain.[A10901]\r\n\r\n* Pain - ibuprofen is widely used to reduce minor aches and pains as well as to reduce fever and manage dysmenorrhea. It is very commonly used for the relief of acute indications such as fever and tension headaches.[A39092] It is also used to manage mild to moderate pain and moderate to severe pain as an adjunct to opioid analgesics.[L40208]\r\n\r\n* Investigational uses - efforts have been put into developing ibuprofen for the prophylaxis of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease, and breast cancer.[A39092]",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: The exact mechanism of action of ibuprofen is unknown. However, ibuprofen is considered an NSAID and thus it is a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, which is an enzyme involved in prostaglandin (mediators of pain and fever) and thromboxane (stimulators of blood clotting) synthesis via the arachidonic acid pathway.[L4614]\r\n\r\nIbuprofen is a non-selective COX inhibitor and hence, it inhibits the activity of both COX-1 and COX-2. The inhibition of COX-2 activity decreases the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in mediating inflammation, pain, fever, and swelling while the inhibition of COX-1 is thought to cause some of the side effects of ibuprofen including GI ulceration.[A39195]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Ibuprofen has multiple actions in different inflammatory pathways involved in acute and chronic inflammation. The main effects reported in ibuprofen are related to the control of pain, fever and acute inflammation by the inhibition of the synthesis of prostanoids by COX-1 and COX-2. Pain relief is attributed to peripheral affected regions and central nervous system effects in the pain transmission mediated by the dorsal horn and higher spinothalamic tract. Some reports have tried to link the pain regulation with a possible enhancement on the synthesis of endogenous cannabinoids and action on the NMDA receptors. The effect on pain has been shown to be related to the cortically evoked potentials.[A39190]\r\n\r\nThe antipyretic effect is reported to be linked to the effect on the prostanoid synthesis due to the fact that the prostanoids are the main signaling mediator of pyresis in the hypothalamic-preoptic region.[A39190]\r\n\r\nThe use of ibuprofen in dental procedures is attributed to the local inhibition of prostanoid production as well as to anti-oedemic activity and an increase of plasma beta-endorphins. Some reports have suggested a rapid local reduction of the expression of COX-2 in dental pulp derived by the administration of ibuprofen.[A39190]\r\n\r\nThe administration of ibuprofen in patients with rheumatic diseases has shown to control joint symptoms.[A39092] \r\n\r\nIbuprofen is largely used in OTC products such as an agent for the management of dysmenorrhea which has been proven to reduce the amount of menstrual prostanoids and to produce a reduction in the uterine hypercontractility.[A39181] As well, it has been reported to reduce significantly the fever and the pain caused by migraines.[A39182, A39183] This effect is thought to be related to the effect on platelet activation and thromboxane A2 production which produces local vascular effects in the affected regions. This effect is viable as ibuprofen can enter in the central nervous system.[A39190]\r\n\r\nIn the investigational uses of ibuprofen, it has been reported to reduce neurodegeneration when given in low doses over a long time.[A39184] On the other hand, its use in Parkinson disease is related to the importance of inflammation and oxidative stress in the pathology of this condition.[A39185] The use of ibuprofen for breast cancer is related to a study that shows a decrease of 50% in the rate of breast cancer.[A39186]",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: Ibuprofen is rapidly metabolized and biotransformed in the liver to the formation of major metabolites which are the hydroxylated and carboxylated derivatives.[A39092] As soon as it is absorbed, the R-enantiomer undergoes extensive enantiomeric conversion (53-65%) to the more active S-enantiomer _in vivo_ by the activity of alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase.[A39194] \r\n\r\nIbuprofen metabolism can be divided in phase I which is represented by the hydroxylation of the isobutyl chains for the formation of 2 or 3-hydroxy derivatives followed by oxidation to 2-carboxy-ibuprofen and p-carboxy-2-propionate. These oxidative reactions are performed by the activity of the cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP 2C9, CYP 2C19 and CYP 2C8. Therefore, these enzymes participate in the oxidation of the alkyl side chain to hydroxyl and carboxyl derivatives. From this enzymes, the major catalyst in the formation of oxidative metabolites is the isoform CYP 2C9.[A39190]\r\n\r\nThe metabolic phase I is followed by a phase II in which the oxidative metabolites may be conjugated to glucuronide prior to excretion. This activity forms phenolic and acyl glucuronides.[A39190]"

It was first introduced in 1984 [A179491] and is available in various countries including Canada and the U.S. According to the 2018 Clinical Practice Guidelines by Diabetes Canada, sulfonylurea drugs are considered a second-line glucose-lowering therapy following metformin.[L6712] Because sulfonylureas require functional pancreatic beta cells for their therapeutic effectiveness, sulfonylureas are more commonly used for early-stage type 2 diabetes when there is no progressed pancreatic failure.[T28] Compared to the first-generation sulfonylureas, such as [tolbutamide] and [chlorpropamide], second-generation sulfonylureas contain a more non-polar side chain in their chemical structure, which enhances their hypoglycemic potency.[A179488] Compared to other members of the sulfonylurea drug group, glipizide displays rapid absorption and onset of action with the shortest half-life and duration of action, reducing the risk for long-lasting hypoglycemia that is often observed with blood glucose-lowering agents.[A179485] Glipizide was first approved by the FDA in 1994 and is available in extended-release tablets under the brand name Glucotrol\u00ae, as well as in combination with metformin under the brand name Metaglip\u00ae.",

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder with increasing prevalence worldwide. Characterized by higher-than-normal levels of blood glucose, T2DM is a complex disorder that arises from the interaction between genetic, environmental and behavioral risk factors. Insulin is a peptide hormone that plays a critical role in regulating blood glucose levels. In response to high blood glucose levels, insulin promotes the uptake of glucose into the liver, muscle cells, and fat cells for storage. Although there are multiple events occurring that lead to the pathophysiology of T2DM, the disorder mainly involves insulin insensitivity as a result of insulin resistance, declining insulin production, and eventual failure of beta cells of pancreatic islets that normally produce insulin.[A179554] Early management with lifestyle intervention, such as controlled diet and exercise, is critical in reducing the risk of long-term secondary complications, such as cardiovascular mortality.\r\n\r\nGlipizide, like other sulfonylurea drugs, is an insulin secretagogue, which works by stimulating the insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells thereby increasing the plasma concentrations of insulin.[A177715] Thus, the main therapeutic action of the drug depends on the functional beta cells in the pancreatic islets.[L6739] Sulfonylureas bind to the sulfonylurea receptor expressed on the pancreatic beta-cell plasma membrane, leading to the closure of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel and reduced potassium conductance. This results in depolarization of the pancreatic beta cell and opening of the voltage-sensitive calcium channels, promoting calcium ion influx. Increased intracellular concentrations of calcium ions in beta cells stimulates the secretion, or exocytosis, of insulin granules from the cells.[label,T28] Apart from this main mechanism of action, the blood-glucose-lowering effect of glipizide involves increased peripheral glucose utilization via stimulating hepatic gluconeogenesis and by increasing the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors.[A177715]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Glipizide is a blood glucose-lowering agent. The initial onset of blood glucose-lowering effect occurs around 30 minutes post-administration with the duration of action lasting for about 12 to 24 hours.[L6739] While the chronic use of glipizide does not result in elevations in the fasting insulin levels over time, the postprandial insulin response, or insulin response to a meal, is observed to be enhanced, even after 6 months of treatment.[label] The main therapeutic actions of glipizide primarily occur at the pancreas where the insulin release is stimulated, but glipizide also mediates some extrapancreatic effects, such as the promotion of insulin signaling effects on the muscles, fat, or liver cells.[L6745] Due to its action on the endogenous cells, sulfonylureas including glipizide is associated with a risk for developing hypoglycemia and weight gain in patients receiving the drug.[A179554,T28] Chronic administration of glipizide may result in down-regulation of the sulfonylurea receptors on pancreatic beta cells, which are molecular targets of the drug, leading to a reduced effect on insulin secretion.[A177715] \r\n\r\nLike other sulfonylureas, glipizide may work on pancreatic delta (\u03b4) cells and alpha (\u03b1) cells to stimulate the secretion of somatostatin and suppress the secretion of glucagon, which are peptide hormones that regulate neuroendocrine and metabolic pathways. Other than its primary action on the pancreas, glipizide also exerts other biological actions outside of the pancreas, or \"extrapancreatic effects\", which is similar to other members of the sulfonylurea drug class. Glipizide may enhance the glucose uptake into the skeletal muscles and potentiate the action of insulin in the liver. Other effects include inhibited lipolysis in the liver and adipose tissue, inhibited hepatic glucose output, and increased uptake and oxidation of glucose. It has also been demonstrated by several studies that the chronic therapeutic use of sulfonylureas may result in an increase in insulin receptors expressed on monocytes, adipocytes, and erythrocytes.[A177715]",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: Glipizide is subject to hepatic metabolism, in which its major metabolites are formed from aromatic hydroxylation. These major metabolites are glipizide are reported to be pharmacologically inactive. In contrast, an acetylaminoethyl benzine derivative is formed as a minor metabolite which accounts for less than 2% of the initial dose and is reported to have one-tenth to one-third as much hypoglycemic activity as the parent compound.[label]"

HIV-1 protease is an enzyme required for the proteolytic cleavage of the viral polyprotein precursors into the individual functional proteins found in infectious HIV-1. Atazanavir binds to the protease active site and inhibits the activity of the enzyme. This inhibition prevents cleavage of the viral polyproteins resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles. Protease inhibitors are almost always used in combination with at least two other anti-HIV drugs. Atazanivir is pharmacologically related but structurally different from other protease inhibitors and other currently available antiretrovirals.[A1697]\r\n\r\nAtazanavir exhibits anti-HIV-1 activity with a mean 50% effective concentration (EC50) in the absence of human serum of 2 to 5 nM against a variety of laboratory and clinical HIV-1 isolates grown in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, macrophages, CEM-SS cells, and MT-2 cells.[L48636] \r\n\r\nAtazanavir has activity against HIV-1 Group M subtype viruses A, B, C, D, AE, AG, F, G, and J isolates in cell culture.

HIV-1 isolates with 93- to 183-fold reduced susceptibility to atazanavir from three different viral strains were selected in cell culture for 5 months. The substitutions in these HIV-1 viruses that contributed to atazanavir resistance include I50L, N88S, I84V, A71V, and M46I. Changes were also observed at the protease cleavage sites following drug selection. Recombinant viruses containing the I50L substitution without other major PI substitutions were growth impaired and displayed increased susceptibility in cell culture to other PIs (amprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir). The I50L and I50V substitutions yielded selective resistance to atazanavir and amprenavir, respectively, and did not appear to be cross-resistant.[L48636] \r\n\r\nConcentration- and dose-dependent prolongation of the PR interval in the electrocardiogram has been observed in healthy subjects receiving atazanavir.

As an OTC medication, diphenhydramine is typically formulated as tablets and creams indicated for use in treating sneezing, runny nose, itchy/watery eyes, itching of nose or throat, insomnia, pruritis, urticaria, insect bites/stings, allergic rashes, and nausea [L5263, L5266, L5269, F3379, A174541].\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when the use of oral diphenhydramine is impractical, there are also prescription-only formulations such as diphenhydramine injection products that are effective in adults and pediatric patients (other than premature infants and neonates) for:\r\ni) the amelioration of allergic reactions to blood or plasma, in anaphylaxis as an adjunct to epinephrine and other standard measures after acute allergic reaction symptoms have been controlled, and for other uncomplicated allergic conditions of the immediate type when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated [F3352];\r\nii) the active treatment of motion sickness [F3352]; and\r\niii) use in parkinsonism when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated, as follows: parkinsonism in the elderly who are unable to tolerate more potent agents; mild cases of parkinsonism in other age groups, and in other cases of parkinsonism in combination with centrally acting anticholinergic agents [F3352].",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Diphenhydramine predominantly works via the antagonism of H1 (Histamine 1) receptors [L5263, L5266, L5269, F3379, A174541]. Such H1 receptors are located on respiratory smooth muscles, vascular endothelial cells, the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), cardiac tissue, immune cells, the uterus, and the central nervous system (CNS) neurons [L5263, L5266, L5269, F3379, A174541]. When the H1 receptor is stimulated in these tissues it produces a variety of actions including increased vascular permeability, promotion of vasodilation causing flushing, decreased atrioventricular (AV) node conduction time, stimulation of sensory nerves of airways producing coughing, smooth muscle contraction of bronchi and the GIT, and eosinophilic chemotaxis that promotes the allergic immune response [L5263, L5266, L5269, F3379, A174541].\r\n\r\nUltimately, diphenhydramine functions as an inverse agonist at H1 receptors, and subsequently reverses effects of histamine on capillaries, reducing allergic reaction symptoms [L5263, L5266, L5269, F3379, A174541]. Moreover, since diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine, it readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and inversely agonizes the H1 CNS receptors, resulting in drowsiness, and suppressing the medullary cough center [L5263, L5266, L5269, F3379, A174541].\r\n\r\nFurthermore, H1 receptors are similar to muscarinic receptors [L5263, L5266, L5269, F3379, A174541]. Consequently, diphenhydramine also acts as an antimuscarinic [L5263, L5266, L5269, F3379, A174541]. It does so by behaving as a competitive antagonist of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, resulting in its use as an antiparkinson medication [L5263, L5266, L5269, F3379, A174541].\r\n\r\nLastly, diphenhydramine has also demonstrated activity as an intracellular sodium channel blocker, resulting in possible local anesthetic properties [L5263].",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Diphenhydramine has anti-histaminic (H1-receptor), anti-emetic, anti-vertigo and sedative and hypnotic properties [L5281]. The anti-histamine action occurs by blocking the spasmogenic and congestive effects of histamine by competing with histamine for H1 receptor sites on effector cells, preventing but not reversing responses mediated by histamine alone [L5281]. Such receptor sites may be found in the gut, uterus, large blood vessels, bronchial muscles, and elsewhere [L5281]. Anti-emetic action is by inhibition at the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone [L5281]. Anti-vertigo action is by a central antimuscarinic effect on the vestibular apparatus and the integrative vomiting center and medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone of the midbrain [L5281].",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: Diphenhydramine undergoes rapid and extensive first-pass metabolism [F3394, L5287, A174577]. In particular, two successive N-demethylations occur wherein diphenhydramine is demethylated to N-desmethyldiphenhydramine (the N-desmethyl metabolite) and then this metabolite is itself demethylated to N,N-didesmethyldiphenhydramine (the N,N-didesmethyl metabolite) [F3394, A174577]. Subsequently, acetyl metabolites like N-acetyl-N-desmethyldiphenhydramine are generated via the amine moiety of the N,N-didesmethyl metabolite [A174577]. Additionally, the N,N-didesmethyl metabolite also undergoes some oxidation to generate the diphenylmethoxyacetic acid metabolite as well [F3394, L5287, A174577]. The remaining percentage of a dose of administered diphenhydramine is excreted unchanged [F3394, L5287, A174577]. The metabolites are further conjugated with glycine and glutamine and excreted in urine [L5287].\r\n\r\nMoreover, studies have determined that a variety of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are involved in the N-demethylation that characterizes the primary metabolic pathway of diphenhydramine, including CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 [A174574]. In particular, CYP2D6 demonstrates higher affinity catalysis with the diphenhydramine substrate than the other isoenzymes identified [A174574]. Consequently, inducers or inhibitors of these such CYP enzymes may potentially affect the serum concentration and incidence and/or severity of adverse effects associated with exposure to diphenhydramine [A174574]."

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: There are 3 key phases of aminoglycoside entry into cells.[A232294] The first \u201cionic binding phase\u201d occurs when polycationic aminoglycosides bind electrostatically to negatively charged components of bacterial cell membranes including with lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids within the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and to teichoic acids and phospholipids within the cell membrane of Gram-positive bacteria. This binding results in displacement of divalent cations and increased membrane permeability, allowing for aminoglycoside entry.[A232294, A232304, A232309, A232314]\r\n\r\nThe second \u201cenergy-dependent phase I\u201d of aminoglycoside entry into the cytoplasm relies on the proton-motive force and allows a limited amount of aminoglycoside access to its primary intracellular target - the bacterial 30S ribosome.[A232294, A232314] This ultimately results in the mistranslation of proteins and disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane.[A233320] Finally, in the \u201cenergy-dependent phase II\u201d stage, concentration-dependent bacterial killing is observed. Aminoglycoside rapidly accumulates in the cell due to the damaged cytoplasmic membrane, and protein mistranslation and synthesis inhibition is amplified.[A232294, A232314, A232319]\r\n\r\nHence, aminoglycosides have both immediate bactericidal effects through membrane disruption and delayed bactericidal effects through impaired protein synthesis; observed experimental data and mathematical modeling support this two-mechanism model.[A232294, A232299]\r\n\r\nInhibition of protein synthesis is a key component of aminoglycoside efficacy. Structural and cell biological studies suggest that aminoglycosides bind to the 16S rRNA in helix 44 (h44), near the A site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, altering interactions between h44 and h45. This binding also displaces two important residues, A1492 and A1493, from h44, mimicking normal conformational changes that occur with successful codon-anticodon pairing in the A site.[A232324, A232329] Overall, aminoglycoside binding has several negative effects including inhibition of translation, initiation, elongation, and ribosome recycling.[A232294, A232334, A232339] Recent evidence suggests that the latter effect is due to a cryptic second binding site situated in h69 of the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit.[A232329, A232339] Also, by stabilizing a conformation that mimics correct codon-anticodon pairing, aminoglycosides promote error-prone translation.[A232344] Mistranslated proteins can incorporate into the cell membrane, inducing the damage discussed above.[A232294, A232319]",

Primaquine acts by interfering with a part of the parasite (mitochondria) that is responsible for supplying it with energy. Without energy the parasite dies. This stops the infection from continuing and allows the person to recover.

This metabolite is responsible for essentially all of the drug's activity in-vivo. The mechanism of action of leflunomide has not been fully determined, but appears to primarily involve regulation of autoimmune lymphocytes. It has been suggested that leflunomide exerts its immunomodulating effects by preventing the expansion of activated autoimmune lymphocytes via interferences with cell cycle progression. In-vitro data indicates that leflunomide interferes with cell cycle progression by inhibiting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (a mitochondrial enzyme involved in de novo pyrimidine ribonucleotide uridine monophosphate (rUMP)synthesis) and has antiproliferative activity. Human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase consists of 2 domains: an \u03b1/\u03b2-barrel domain containing the active site and an \u03b1-helical domain that forms a tunnel leading to the active site. A77 1726 binds to the hydrophobic tunnel at a site near the flavin mononucleotide. Inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase by A77 1726 prevents production of rUMP by the de novo pathway; such inhibition leads to decreased rUMP levels, decreased DNA and RNA synthesis, inhibition of cell proliferation, and G1 cell cycle arrest. It is through this action that leflunomide inhibits autoimmune T-cell proliferation and production of autoantibodies by B cells. Since salvage pathways are expected to sustain cells arrested in the G1 phase, the activity of leflunomide is cytostatic rather than cytotoxic. Other effects that result from reduced rUMP levels include interference with adhesion of activated lymphocytes to the synovial vascular endothelial cells, and increased synthesis of immunosuppressive cytokines such as transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2). Leflunomide is also a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Tyrosine kinases activate signalling pathways leading to DNA repair, apoptosis and cell proliferation. Inhibition of tyrosine kinases can help to treating cancer by preventing repair of tumor cells. ",

RA is an auto-immune disease characterized by high T-cell activity. T cells have two pathways to synthesize pyrimidines: the salvage pathways and the de novo synthesis. At rest, T lymphocytes meet their metabolic requirements by the salvage pathway. Activated lymphocytes need to expand their pyrimidine pool 7- to 8-fold, while the purine pool is expanded only 2- to 3-fold. To meet the need for more pyrimidines, activated T cells use the de novo pathway for pyrimidine synthesis. Therefore, activated T cells, which are dependent on de novo pyrimidine synthesis, will be more affected by leflunomide's inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase than other cell types that use the salvage pathway of pyrimidine synthesis.",

More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as \"bad cholesterol\"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]\r\n\r\nRosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]\r\n\r\nWhile all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]'s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.\r\n\r\nRosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]",

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Rosuvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421] Rosuvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Rosuvastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL).[F4649] The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL. \r\n\r\nIn vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that rosuvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.\r\n\r\nStatins have also been found to bind allosterically to \u03b22 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.[A181559]\r\n\r\nRosuvastatin exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on rat mesenteric microvascular endothelium by attenuating leukocyte rolling, adherence and transmigration.[A1807] The drug also modulates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression and reduces ischemic-reperfusion injuries in rat hearts.[A1787] Rosuvastatin increases the bioavailability of nitric oxide[A1807,A1799,A1787] by upregulating NOS[A1791] and by increasing the stability of NOS through post-transcriptional polyadenylation.[A1796] It is unclear as to how rosuvastatin brings about these effects though they may be due to decreased concentrations of mevalonic acid.",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Rosuvastatin is a synthetic, enantiomerically pure antilipemic agent. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A181087, A181406]\r\n\r\nElevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]\r\n\r\n**Skeletal Muscle Effects**\r\n\r\nCases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. These risks can occur at any dose level, but are increased at the highest dose (40 mg). Rosuvastatin should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy (e.g., age \u2265 65 years, inadequately treated hypothyroidism, renal impairment).\r\n\r\nThe risk of myopathy during treatment with rosuvastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid-lowering therapies (such as [fenofibrate] or [niacin]), [gemfibrozil], [cyclosporine], [atazanavir]/[ritonavir], [lopinavir]/ritonavir, or [simeprevir].  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin, coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[F4649] \r\n\r\nReal-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]\r\n\r\n**Liver Enzyme Abnormalities**\r\n\r\nIncreases in serum transaminases have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There were two cases of jaundice, for which a relationship to rosuvastatin therapy could not be determined, which resolved after discontinuation of therapy. There were no cases of liver failure or irreversible liver disease in these trials.[F4649]\r\n\r\n**Endocrine Effects**\r\n\r\nIncreases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin calcium tablets. Based on clinical trial data with rosuvastatin, in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.[F4649]\r\n\r\nAn in vitro study found that [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], and [pitavastatin] exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreas islet \u03b2 cells, with reductions in cell viability of 32, 41, 34 and 29%, respectively, versus control]. Moreover, insulin secretion rates were decreased by 34, 30, 27 and 19%, respectively, relative to control.[A182012]\r\n\r\nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and lower cholesterol levels and, as such, might theoretically blunt adrenal or gonadal steroid hormone production. Rosuvastatin demonstrated no effect upon nonstimulated cortisol levels and no effect on thyroid metabolism as assessed by TSH plasma concentration. In rosuvastatin treated patients, there was no impairment of adrenocortical reserve and no reduction in plasma cortisol concentrations. Clinical studies with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not reduce plasma testosterone concentration. The effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on male fertility have not been studied. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4652]\r\n\r\n**Cardiovascular**\r\n\r\nUbiquinone levels were not measured in rosuvastatin clinical trials, however significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4652]\r\n\r\n**Lipoprotein A**\r\n\r\nIn some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by a concomitant increase in the Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease. It is thus desirable to maintain and reinforce lifestyle changes in high-risk patients placed on rosuvastatin therapy.[F4652] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]",

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Capecitabine is metabolized to 5-fluorouracil in vivo by carboxylesterases, cytidine deaminase, and thymidine phosphorylase/uridine phosphorylase sequentially.[L44657,A256027,A256142,A256147,A32078] 5-fluorouracil is further metabolized through a series of enzymatic reactions into 3 main active metabolites: 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (5-FUTP), 5-fluoro-2\u2019-deoxyuridine monophosphate (5-FdUMP), and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine triphosphate (5-FdUTP).[A256062,A256027,A256077]. These metabolites cause cell injury by two different mechanisms. First, FdUMP and the folate cofactor, N5-10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH<sub>2</sub>THF), bind to thymidylate synthase (TS) to form a covalently bound ternary complex.[L44657] TS is an enzyme that catalyzes the methylation of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP).[A256152,A256077] Under normal physiological conditions, dUMP binds to TS first before CH<sub>2</sub>THF, followed by a 1,4 or Michael addition from the pyrimidine C (6)atom to the Cys146 nucleophile.[A256152,A256157] If correctly positioned, dUMP, CH<sub>2</sub>THF, and TS would form a ternary complex to facilitate the donation of the methyl group from CH<sub>2</sub>THF to dUMP.[A256152] However, the substitution of dUMP with FdUMP results in a new time-dependent TS\u2013FdUMP\u2013CH2THF complex. Since the fluorine group prevents dissociation of FdUMP from the pyrimidine ring, the whole complex is rendered irreversibly deactivated, terming this reaction \"suicide inhibition\".[A256152,A256162] TS inhibition prevents the conversion of dUMP to dTMP, depleting the pool of dTMP that could be phosphorylated into dTTP to be incorporated as DNA nucleotides. This disrupts the nucleotides balance, particularly the the ATP/dTTP ratio, thus impairing DNA synthesis and repair and causing apoptosis.[A256167,A256152] \r\n\r\n5-FdUMP can also be phosphorylated into 5-FdUTP, further increasing the pool of dUTP base to potentially overwhelm the activity of dUTPase.[A256177] Coupled with the decrease in dTTP, 5-FdUMP, and 5-FdUTP increase the probability of mistakenly incorporating a uracil base into DNA strands in place of thymine. Although this mistake can often be resolved by the nucleotide excision repair enzyme uracil-DNA-glycosylase (UDG), the high (F)dUTP/dTTP ratio would result in re-incorporation of uracil into DNA, leading to a futile cycle of misincorporation, excision, and repair.[A256172,A841] Repeated base excision repair can result in abasic sites, which can lead to DNA mutagenesis and thus protein miscoding, replication forks collapse, and DNA fragmentation through single or double strand breaks [A256177,A256182,A256187,A256192] \r\n\r\nHowever, several reports have found that the incorporation of uracil in genomic DNA does not significantly affect the cytotoxicity of 5-FU, suggesting that the cytotoxic effect of 5-FU is dominated by the perturbation of RNA through 5-FUTP.[A256197,A256202] Similar to 5-dFUTP, 5-FUTP can be mistakenly incorporated into RNA in place of regular UTP and disrupt regular RNA biology through various mechanisms. 5-FUTP can be incorporated into the spliceosomal U2 snRNA at pseudouridylated sites to prevent further pseudouridylation and thus pre-mrNA splicing. 5-FUTP can also change the structure of U4 and U6 snRNA and reduce the turnover rate of U1 snrNA once incorporated.[A256207] For tRNA, 5-FUTP can affect tRNA's post-transcriptional RNA modifications activity, particularly by inhbiting pseudouridine synthase through formation of covalent complex.[A256212,A256217] Recently, the effect of 5-FUTP on miRNAs and lncRNA was also observed through profound changes in expression, although the precise mechanism is still unknown.[A256222,A256227,A256232]\r\n\r\nAlthough the main mechanism of 5-FU cytotoxicity was thought to be attributed to DNA damages, recent reports have shown that the majority of 5-FU pharmacological action is mediated through RNA, since 5-FU is accumulated ~3000- to 15\u2009000-fold more in RNA compared to that of DNA.[A256237] \r\n",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Capecitabine is a fluoropyrimidine carbamate belonging to a group of antineoplastic agents called antimetabolites, which kill cancerous cells by interfering with DNA synthesis.[A256242,A841] It is an orally administered systemic prodrug that has little pharmacologic activity until it is converted to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) by enzymes that are expressed in higher concentrations in many tumors.[A256247] Capecitabine was designed specifically to overcome the disadvantages of 5-FU and to mimic the infusional pharmacokinetics of 5-FU without the associated complexity and complications of central venous access and infusion pumps.[A256242] Particularly, since the enzymes converting 5-FU into active metabolites exist in the gastrointestinal tract, infusion of 5-FU can have gastrointestinal toxicity while also losing efficacy.[A256252] Since capecitabine can be transported intact across the intestinal mucosa, it can be selectively delivered 5-FU to tumor tissues through enzymatic conversion preferentially inside tumor cells.[A256252]\r\n\r\n5-FU exerts its pharmacological action through the inhibition and interference of 3 main targets: thymidylate synthase, DNA, and RNA, leading through protein synthesis disruption and apoptosis.[A841,A256152] Population-based exposure-effect analyses demonstrated a positive association between AUC of 5-FU and grade 3-4 hyperbilirubinemia.[L44657]",

Unique among the azoles, miconazole is thought to act through three main mechanisms.[A203636] The primary mechanism of action is through inhibition of the CYP450 14\u03b1-lanosterol demethylase enzyme, which results in altered ergosterol production and impaired cell membrane composition and permeability, which in turn leads to cation, phosphate, and low molecular weight protein leakage.[A203636, A203639]\r\n\r\nIn addition, miconazole inhibits fungal peroxidase and catalase while not affecting NADH oxidase activity, leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).[A203636, A203639, A203642] Increased intracellular ROS leads to downstream pleiotropic effects and eventual apoptosis.[A203636]\r\n\r\nLastly, likely as a result of lanosterol demethylation inhibition, miconazole causes a rise in intracellular levels of farnesol. This molecule participates in quorum sensing in _Candida_, preventing the transition from yeast to mycelial forms and thereby the formation of biofilms, which are more resistant to antibiotics.[A203645, A203648] In addition, farnesol is an inhibitor of drug efflux ABC transporters, namely _Candida_ CaCdr1p and CaCdr2p, which may additionally contribute to increased effectiveness of azole drugs.[A203648]",

It is structurally similar to acetohexamide, chlorpropamide and tolazamide and belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating \u03b2 cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic \u03b2 cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Tolbutamide appears to be metabolized in the liver.

It is a novel dual 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor that works by blocking both isoforms of 5\u03b1-reductase enzymes in a potent, selective, and irreversible manner.[A1909] Type I and II 5\u03b1-reductase enzymes convert testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a primary hormonal mediator that plays a role in the development and enlargement of the prostate gland. Dutasteride was approved by the FDA in 2001 for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men as monotherapy or in combination with the \u03b1-adrenergic antagonist [tamsulosin] to enhance the therapeutic response. Its clinical efficacy against benign prostate hyperplasia in male patients is comparable to that of [finasteride], a specific type II 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor. However, unlike finasteride, dutasteride is not yet indicated for the treatment of androgenic alopecia although it was demonstrated to be effective in several randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in androgenetic alopecia.[A178333,A178336]",

It serves as the hormonal mediator for the hyperplasia upon accumulation within the prostate gland.[A178270] DHT displays a higher affinity towards androgen receptors in the prostate gland compared to testosterone[T28] and by acting on the androgen receptors, DHT modulates genes that are responsible for cell proliferation.[A178279] Responsible for the synthesis of approximately one-third of circulating DHT, type I 5\u03b1-reductase is predominant in the sebaceous glands of most regions of skin, including the scalp, and liver. The type II 5a-reductase isozyme is primarily found in the prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymides, and hair follicles as well as liver, and is responsible for two-thirds of circulating DHT.[L10568] Due to its dual inhibition of both isoenzymes of 5\u03b1-reductase, dutasteride causes a near-complete suppression of DHT.[A178348] Compared to a 70% reduction of serum DHT levels caused by [finasteride], a near-complete suppression of serum DHT-more than 90% is seen with dutasteride.[A178378]\r\n\r\nBy forming a stable complex with both type II and type II 5\u03b1-reductase, dutasteride inhibits its enzymatic action of converting testosterone to 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is the androgen primarily responsible for the initial development and subsequent enlargement of the prostate gland. It is proposed that DHT is the principal androgen responsible for prostatic growth in later life-normal masculinization of the external genitalia and maturation of the prostate gland during development-thus reducing the serum DHT levels results in reduced prostatic volume and increased epithelial apoptosis.[A178375] Dutasteride is a competitive and specific inhibitor of both Type I and Type II 5\u03b1-reductase isoenzymes and when evaluated under _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ conditions, the dissociation of the drug from the drug-enzyme complex is reported to be extremely slow.[L10568] Dutasteride does not bind to the human androgen receptor.[L10568]",

Dutasteride works by reducing the levels of circulating DHT. It was also shown to reduce the size of the prostate gland, improve urinary flow, and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia alone or in combination with tamsulosin.[L6256] The effect of the reduction of DHT by dutasteride is dose-dependent, with the maximum effect observed within 1-2 weeks following initial administration.[L10568] \r\n\r\nAfter 1 and 2 weeks of daily dosing with dutasteride 0.5 mg, median serum DHT concentrations were reduced by 85% and 90%, respectively.[L10568] The serum concentrations of DHT were maintained to be decreased by more than 90% in 85% of patients following 1 years' administration of oral dutasteride 0.5 mg/day.[A178345] As evident from the clinical studies, dutasteride may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer.[L10568] ",

According to _in vitro_ studies, 4\u2032-hydroxydutasteride and 1,2-dihydrodutasteride mediated inhibitory actions against both isoforms of 5\u03b1-reductase but with lower potency when compared to the parent drug.

The latter indication was presented by Pernix Therapeutics.[L5974]",

This condition can lead to emotional and physical disturbances that can decrease the ability of a person to function in a regular environment.[L5980]\r\n\r\nAnxiety is a normal reaction of the body towards a normal danger. When the anxious state is exacerbated or appears on situations without danger, it is defined as an anxiety disorder. This disorders can appear in different forms such as phobias, panic, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.[L5983]\r\n\r\nInsomnia is a sleep disorder that directly affects the quality of life of the individual. It is characterized by the complication either to fall asleep or to stay asleep.

However, doxepin is known to be a selective histamine H1 receptor blocker.[A177163] This effect on histamine receptors indicates effectiveness in skin conditions.[T249]\r\n\r\nBreaking its function according to the different effect, doxepin's antidepressive action is primarily associated with the inhibition of the central nervous system biogenic amine reuptake; more specifically, norepinephrine and serotonin at synaptic nerve terminals. This effect increases the level of monoamines in the synaptic site which in order increases the activity at the post-synaptic neuron receptor sites.[T388] It has been suggested that doxepin also desensitizes both serotonin 1A receptors and beta-adrenergic receptors.[T249]\r\n\r\nIt is known that the lack of dopamine transporters in the frontal cortex and the transmission of dopamine in this region is largely inactivated by the effect of norepinephrine reuptake.

They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, desipramine does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, desipramine exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Secondary amine TCAs, such as desipramine and nortriptyline, are more potent inhibitors of norepinephrine reuptake than tertiary amine TCAs, such as amitriptyline and doxepine. TCAs also down-regulate cerebral cortical &beta;-adrenergic receptors and sensitize post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine-H<sub>1</sub> receptors, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively. See toxicity section below for a complete listing of side effects. Desipramine exerts less anticholinergic and sedative side effects compared to tertiary amine TCAs, such as amitriptyline and clomipramine.

Inhibition of neurotransmitter reuptake increases stimulation of the post-synaptic neuron.  Chronic use of desipramine also leads to down-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors in the cerebral cortex and sensitization of serotonergic receptors. An overall increase in serotonergic transmission likely confers desipramine its antidepressant effects.

Desipramine exhibits greater noradrenergic re-uptake inhibition compared to the tertiary amine TCA imipramine. In addition to inhibiting neurotransmitter re-uptake, desipramine down-regulates beta-adrenergic receptors in the cerebral cortex and sensitizes serotonergic receptors with chronic use.

Bupropion exerts its pharmacological effects by weakly inhibiting the enzymes involved in the uptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine from the synaptic cleft, therefore prolonging their duration of action within the neuronal synapse and the downstream effects of these neurotransmitters. More specifically, bupropion binds to the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and the dopamine transporter (DAT).[A6399,A178810]\r\n\r\nBupropion was originally classified as an \"atypical\" antidepressant because it does not exert the same effects as the classical antidepressants such as Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs), Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs), or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). While it has comparable effectiveness to typical first-line options for the treatment of depression such as SSRIs,[A178798,A178804] bupropion is a unique option for the treatment of MDD as it lacks any clinically relevant serotonergic effects, typical of other mood medications, or any effects on histamine or adrenaline receptors.[A6399,A178840] Lack of activity at these receptors results in a more tolerable side effect profile; bupropion is less likely to cause sexual side effects, sedation, or weight gain as compared to SSRIs or TCAs, for example.[A178804,A178807]\r\n\r\nWhen used as an aid to smoking cessation, bupropion is thought to confer its anti-craving and anti-withdrawal effects by inhibiting dopamine reuptake, which is thought to be involved in the reward pathways associated with nicotine, and through the antagonism of the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor.[A178825,A1966,A16508] A Cochrane Review of meta-analyses of available treatment modalities for smoking cessation found that abstinence rates approximately doubled when bupropion was used as compared to placebo, and was found to have similar rates of smoking cessation as [nicotine] replacement therapy (NRT).[A178816]\r\n\r\nBupropion is sometimes used as an add-on agent to first-line treatments of depression such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications when there is a treatment-failure or only partial response.[A178789] Bupropion is also used off-label for the management of Attention/Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults with comorbid bipolar depression to avoid mood destabilization caused by typical stimulant medications used for the treatment of ADHD.[F4624]\r\n\r\nWhen used in combination with [naltrexone] in the marketed product Contrave\u24c7 for chronic weight management, the two components are thought to have effects on areas of the brain involved in the regulation of food intake.

            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Bupropion is chemically unrelated to tricyclic, tetracyclic, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, or other known antidepressant agents. Compared to classical tricyclic antidepressants, Bupropion is a relatively weak inhibitor of the neuronal uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine. In addition, Bupropion does not inhibit monoamine oxidase. Bupropion has been found to be essentially inactive at the serotonin transporter (SERT)(IC50 >10 000 nM),[A178810] however both bupropion and its primary metabolite hydroxybupropion have been found to block the function of cation-selective serotonin type 3A receptors (5-HT3ARs). \r\n\r\nBupropion produces dose-related central nervous system (CNS) stimulant effects in animals, as evidenced by increased locomotor activity, increased rates of responding in various schedule-controlled operant behaviour tasks, and, at high doses, induction of mild stereotyped behaviour [FDA Label]. Due to these stimulant effects and selective activity at dopamine and norepinephrine receptors, bupropion has been identified as having an abuse potential.[FDA Label,A178846] Bupropion has a similar structure to the controlled substance [DB01560], and has been identified as having mild amphetamine-like activity, particularly when inhaled or injected.[A178846]\r\n\r\nBupropion is also known to lower the seizure threshold, making any pre-existing seizure conditions a contraindication to its use. This risk is exacerbated when bupropion is combined with other drugs or substances that lower the seizure threshold, such as [cocaine], or in clinical situations that would increase the risk of a seizure such as abrupt alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal.[FDA Label] As norepinephrine has been shown to have anticonvulsant properties, bupropion's inhibitory effects on NET are thought to contribute to its pro-convulsant activity.[A178846]\r\n\r\nBupropion has been shown to increase blood pressure and pose a risk for exacerbation of unmanaged or pre-existing hypertension,[A178852,FDA Label] however, clinical trials of bupropion in smokers with CVD have not identified an increased incidence of CV events including stroke or heart attack.[A178855] In clinical trials, the mean increase in systolic blood pressure associated with the use of bupropion was found to be 1.3 mmHg.[FDA Label]",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: Bupropion is extensively metabolized in humans. Three metabolites are active: hydroxybupropion, which is formed via hydroxylation of the tert-butyl group of bupropion, and the amino-alcohol isomers, threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion, which are formed via reduction of the carbonyl group. In vitro findings suggest that CYP2B6 is the principal isoenzyme involved in the formation of hydroxybupropion, while cytochrome P450 enzymes are not involved in the formation of threohydrobupropion. Hydroxybupropion has been shown to have the same affinity as bupropion for the norepinephrine transporter (NET) but approximately 50% of its antidepressant activity despite reaching concentrations of ~10-fold higher than that of the parent drug.[A179062]\r\n\r\nOxidation of the bupropion side chain results in the formation of a glycine conjugate of meta-chlorobenzoic acid, which is then excreted as the major urinary metabolite. The potency and toxicity of the metabolites relative to bupropion have not been fully characterized. However, it has been demonstrated in an antidepressant screening test in mice that hydroxybupropion is one-half as potent as bupropion, while threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion are 5-fold less potent than bupropion. This may be of clinical importance because the plasma concentrations of the metabolites are as high as or higher than those of bupropion.[FDA Label]\r\n\r\nBupropion and its metabolites exhibit linear kinetics following chronic administration of 300 to 450 mg per day."

Inhibition of DHFR results in the depletion of this coenzyme, leading directly to interference with thymidylate biosynthesis, as well as inhibition of folate-dependent formyltransferases, and indirectly to inhibition of p.r.n. biosynthesis.

Generally, the most sensitive cells to the antimetabolite effect of trimetrexate are those cells which are most actively proliferating such as malignant cells, dermal epithelium, buccal and intestinal mucosa, bone marrow, fetal cells, and cells of the urinary bladder. Because the proliferation of cells in malignant tissues is greater than in most normal tissues, trimetrexate may impair the growth of the malignant tissues without causing irreversible damage to normal tissues.

The absence of functional t-RNA could cause the cessation of protein synthesis and consequently DNA and RNA synthesis. In addition, procarbazine may directly damage DNA.

Alkylating agents are so named because of their ability to add alkyl groups to many electronegative groups under conditions present in cells. They stop tumor growth by cross-linking guanine bases in DNA double-helix strands - directly attacking DNA. This makes the strands unable to uncoil and separate. As this is necessary in DNA replication, the cells can no longer divide. In addition, these drugs add methyl or other alkyl groups onto molecules where they do not belong which in turn inhibits their correct utilization by base pairing and causes a miscoding of DNA. Procarbazine is cell-phase specific for the S phase of cell division.",

Guanethidine at the nerve terminal blocks the release of noradrenaline in response to an action potential. In contrast to ganglionic blocking agents, Guanethidine suppresses equally the responses mediated by alpha-and beta-adrenergic receptors but does not produce parasympathetic blockade. Since sympathetic blockade results in modest decreases in peripheral resistance and cardiac output, Guanethidine lowers blood pressure in the supine position. It further reduces blood pressure by decreasing the degree of vasoconstriction that normally results from reflex sympathetic nervous activity upon assumption of the upright posture, thus reducing venous return and cardiac output more.",

Diastolic excitability threshold is increased and effective refractory period prolonged. Propafenone reduces spontaneous automaticity and depresses triggered activity.

            "summary": "Naloxone is an opioid antagonist medication used to block or reverse the effects of opioid drugs, particularly within the setting of drug overdoses which are rapidly becoming a leading cause of death worldwide.[A234594] More specifically, naloxone has a high affinity for \u03bc-opioid receptors, where it acts as an inverse agonist, causing the rapid removal of any other drugs bound to these receptors.[A234594] When taken in large quantities, opioid medications such as [morphine], [hydromorphone], [methadone], [heroin], or [fentanyl] are capable of causing life-threatening symptoms such as respiratory depression, reduced heart rate, slurred speech, drowsiness, and constricted pupils.[A234594,L33724] If untreated, this can progress to vomiting, absent pulse and breathing, loss of consciousness, and even death.[L33724] Naloxone is indicated for the rapid reversal of these symptoms of central nervous system depression in opioid overdose.[A234589] It's important to note that naloxone only works on opioid receptors within the body, and is therefore not capable of reversing the effects of non-opioid medications such as stimulants like [methamphetamine] or [cocaine], or benzodiazepines like [lorazepam] or [diazepam]. \r\n\r\nAlso known as the brand name product Narcan, naloxone is currently available by intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SubQ) injection, nasal spray, or intravenous (IV) infusion.[L33729,L33739] Naloxone IM injections are commonly available in the form of \"kits\", which is ideal for making overdose treatment accessible and readily available for administration by minimally trained individuals within the community.[L33734] Kits commonly include the supplies necessary to treat an overdose in a non-medical setting such as alcohol swabs, syringes, a rescue breathing mask, and instructions for use. Frequently also carried by medical and emergency personnel and at events known to be associated with heavy drug use like music festivals, naloxone kits are considered a key component of harm reduction strategies. There are over-the-counter nasal sprays available.\r\n\r\nWhen injected intramuscularly (IM), naloxone acts within three to five minutes. Administration of naloxone is associated with very few side effects. Notably, if injected into a person not currently using opioid medications, there would be no noticeable effects at all. However, for individuals using opioid medications or experiencing an overdose, IM injection of naloxone rapidly reverses opioid effects and can cause the injected individual to immediately experience withdrawal symptoms.[A234589] Common symptoms of opioid withdrawal include nausea, vomiting, sweating, runny nose, aches, and diarrhea.[A234589] Although certainly physically uncomfortable, opioid withdrawal symptoms are not life-threatening; administration of naloxone is, therefore, appropriate for any person appearing to have any symptoms of an opioid overdose. Due to its short duration of action, persons injected with naloxone should be monitored for responsiveness and potentially injected a second time or taken to the hospital.[A234589]\r\n\r\nNaloxone is also available within the combination product Suboxone with the opioid medication [buprenorphine].[L33714,L33719] Suboxone is used for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence and addiction.[L33714,L33719] When taken orally, naloxone has no pharmacological effect and does not reduce the effectiveness of the opioid effect of buprenorphine.[L33714,L33719] The primary purpose of including naloxone within Suboxone is to act as a deterrent to injection, as injected naloxone would rapidly reverse the effects of buprenorphine.[L33714,L33719]\r\n\r\nNaloxone was granted FDA approval on 13 April 1971.[L33709]",

In lactotrophs, stimulation of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor causes inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, which decreases intracellular cAMP concentrations and blocks IP3-dependent release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores. Decreases in intracellular calcium levels may also be brought about via inhibition of calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels, rather than via inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Additionally, receptor activation blocks phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK and decreases MAPK/ERK kinase phosphorylation. Inhibition of MAPK appears to be mediated by c-Raf and B-Raf-dependent inhibition of MAPK/ERK kinase. Dopamine-stimulated growth hormone release from the pituitary gland is mediated by a decrease in intracellular calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels rather than via adenylyl cyclase inhibition. Stimulation of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway leads to improvements in coordinated muscle activity in those with movement disorders. ",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Pergolide stimulates centrally-located dopaminergic receptors resulting in a number of pharmacologic effects. Five dopamine receptor types from two dopaminergic subfamilies have been identified. The dopaminergic D1 receptor subfamily consists of D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>5</sub> subreceptors and are associated with dyskinesias. The dopaminergic D2 receptor subfamily consists of D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub> and D<sub>4</sub> subreceptors and has been associated with improvement of symptoms of movement disorders. Thus, agonist activity specific for D2 subfamily receptors, primarily D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> receptor subtypes, are the primary targets of dopaminergic antiparkinsonian agents. It is thought that postsynaptic D2 stimulation is primarily responsible for the antiparkinsonian effect of dopamine agonists, while presynaptic D2 stimulation confers neuroprotective effects. This semisynthetic ergot derivative exhibits potent agonist activity on dopamine D<sub>2</sub>- and D<sub>3</sub>-receptors. It also exhibits agonist activity on dopamine D<sub>4</sub>, D<sub>1</sub>, and D<sub>5</sub>, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>, &alpha;<sub>2A</sub>-, &alpha;<sub>2B</sub>-, &alpha;<sub>2C</sub>-, &alpha;<sub>1A</sub>-, &alpha;<sub>1B</sub>-, and &alpha;<sub>1D</sub>-adrenergic receptors. Parkinsonian Syndrome manifests when approximately 80% of dopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain is lost. As this striatum is involved in modulating the intensity of coordinated muscle activity (e.g. movement, balance, walking), loss of activity may result in dystonia (acute muscle contraction), Parkinsonism (including symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and flattened affect), akathesia (inner restlessness), tardive dyskinesia (involuntary muscle movements usually associated with long-term loss of dopaminergic activity), and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which manifests when complete blockage of nigrostriatal dopamine occurs. High dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain causes hallucinations and delusions; these side effects of dopamine agonists are manifestations seen in patients with schizophrenia who have overractivity in this area of the brain. The hallucinogenic side effects of dopamine agonists may also be due to 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> agonism. The tuberoinfundibular pathway of the brain originates in the hypothalamus and terminates in the pituitary gland. In this pathway, dopamine inhibits lactotrophs in anterior pituitary from secreting prolactin. Increased dopaminergic activity in the tuberoinfundibular pathway inhibits prolactin secretion. Pergolide also causes transient increases in somatotropin (growth hormone) secretion and decreases in luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations. ",

May improve survival in patients with left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction. May be used to treat nephropathy, including diabetic nephropathy. ",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: There are two isoforms of ACE: the somatic isoform, which exists as a glycoprotein comprised of a single polypeptide chain of 1277; and the testicular isoform, which has a lower molecular mass and is thought to play a role in sperm maturation and binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelium. Somatic ACE has two functionally active domains, N and C, which arise from tandem gene duplication. Although the two domains have high sequence similarity, they play distinct physiological roles. The C-domain is predominantly involved in blood pressure regulation while the N-domain plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. ACE inhibitors bind to and inhibit the activity of both domains, but have much greater affinity for and inhibitory activity against the C-domain. Captopril, one of the few ACE inhibitors that is not a prodrug, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII. Decreasing ATII levels in the body decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the pressor effects of ATII as described in the Pharmacology section above. Captopril also causes an increase in plasma renin activity likely due to a loss of feedback inhibition mediated by ATII on the release of renin and/or stimulation of reflex mechanisms via baroreceptors. Captopril\u2019s affinity for ACE is approximately 30,000 times greater than that of ATI.",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Captopril, an ACE inhibitor, antagonizes the effect of the RAAS. The RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from the granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. In the blood stream, renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to ATI, which is subsequently cleaved to ATII by ACE. ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. First, it stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone travels to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting tubule of nephrons where it increases sodium and water reabsorption by increasing the number of sodium channels and sodium-potassium ATPases on cell membranes. Second, ATII stimulates the secretion of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. Third, ATII increases blood pressure through direct arterial vasoconstriction. Stimulation of the Type 1 ATII receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells leads to a cascade of events resulting in myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. In addition to these major effects, ATII induces the thirst response via stimulation of hypothalamic neurons. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. ACE (also known as kininase II) is also involved in the enzymatic deactivation of bradykinin, a vasodilator. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may sustain its effects by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.",

Current knowledge suggests that levetiracetam\u2019s binding to synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) is a key driver of its action. SV2A is a membrane-bound protein that is found on synaptic vesicles and is ubiquitous throughout the CNS[A12546] - it appears to play a role in vesicle exocytosis[L8606,L8615] and in the modulation of synaptic transmission by increasing the available amount of secretory vesicles available for neurotransmission.[A12552] Stimulation of pre-synaptic SV2A by levetiracetam may inhibit neurotransmitter release,[A12551] but this action does not appear to affect normal neurotransmission. This has led to the suggestion that levetiracetam exclusively modulates the function of SV2A only under pathophysiological conditions.[A12546] Levetiracetam and related analogues showed a correlation between affinity for SV2A and anti-epileptic potency, further suggesting that action at this site contributes to the anti-epileptic activity of the drug.[L8606,L8615]\r\n\r\nLevetiracetam has also been shown to indirectly affect GABAergic neurotransmission (despite having no direct effect on GABAergic or glutamatergic receptors) and modulate ionic currents.[A12552] Similarly, levetiracetam has been shown in vitro to inhibit N-type calcium channels.[A16562] How, or even if, these actions are implicated in its anti-epileptic action have yet to be elucidated.",

This destroys the cell's ability to use its cytoskeleton in a flexible manner. Specifically, docetaxel binds to the &beta;-subunit of tubulin. Tubulin is the \"building block\" of microtubules, and the binding of docetaxel locks these building blocks in place. The resulting microtubule/docetaxel complex does not have the ability to disassemble. This adversely affects cell function because the shortening and lengthening of microtubules (termed dynamic instability) is necessary for their function as a transportation highway for the cell. Chromosomes, for example, rely upon this property of microtubules during mitosis. Further research has indicated that docetaxel induces programmed cell death (apoptosis) in cancer cells by binding to an apoptosis-stopping protein called Bcl-2 (B-cell leukemia 2), thus arresting its function.[A259666,A259671,L46466]",

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Once nelarabine is metabolized into ara-GTP, the metabolite accumulates in leukemic blasts and incorporates into DNA to exert its S phase-specific cytotoxic effects, leading to the induction of fragmentation and apoptosis. As a nucleoside analog, Ara-GTP competes with endogenous deoxyGTP (dGTP) for incorporation into DNA.[A2333,A2334,A2335,A2336] Due to its intact 3'-OH group, ara-GTP can be incorporated into the growing DNA strand without absolute chain termination.[A2337] Despite that, the inclusion of ara-GTP into DNA strand can impair proper DNA repair processes, although the exact mechanism is not well understood, leading to inhibition of DNA elongation, apoptosis, and cellular destruction. Additional cytotoxic activities may exist, but these are not fully understood.[A2332,A2333,A2334,A2337]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Nelarabine is a prodrug of the cytotoxic deoxyguanosine analogue 9-&szlig;-D-arabinofuranosylguanine (ara-G). Nelarabine is demethylated by adenosine deaminase (ADA) to ara-G.[L40878] Ara-G is then transported into cells, where it undergoes three phosphorylation steps, resulting in the formation of ara-G triphosphate (ara-GTP). In the first phosphorylation step, ara-G is converted to ara-G monophosphate (ara-GMP).[L40878] Ara-GMP is then monophosphorylated by deoxyguanosine kinase and deoxycytidine kinase to ara-G diphosphate, and then subsequently to the active ara-G triphosphate (ara-GTP). Ara-GTP is the one that exerts the pharmacological effect. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that targeted T-cells possess marked sensitivity to the agent.[L40878] Since T lymphoblasts have a higher expression of deoxycytidine kinase, ara-G preferentially accumulates in T cells over B cells, thus showing higher toxicity to T lymphoblasts.[A2331,AA2334,2335]",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: The principal route of metabolism for nelarabine is O-demethylation by adenosine deaminase to form ara-G, which undergoes hydrolysis to form guanine. In addition, some nelarabine is hydrolyzed to form methylguanine, which is O-demethylated to form guanine. Guanine is N-deaminated to form xanthine, which is further oxidized to yield uric acid.[L40878] Ring opening of uric acid followed by further oxidation results in the formation of allantoin.[L45833]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRing opening of uric acid followed by further oxidation results in the formation of allantoin."

Bismuth interacts with other anions and compounds, such as hydrochloric acid, bicarbonate, phosphate, and hydrogen sulfide, in the gastrointestinal tract to form bismuth salts such as bismuth oxychloride, bismuth subcarbonate, bismuth phosphate, and bismuth sulfide.[A230728, A230733] Bismuth salts possess bactericidal and antimicrobial activity, mainly by preventing bacteria from binding and growing on the mucosal cells of the stomach. It has no effects on normal gut flora. By preventing bacteria from binding to mucosal cells, bismuth subsalicylate prevents intestinal secretion and fluid loss, promotes fluid and electrolyte reabsorption, reduces gastrointestinal inflammation, and promotes the healing of pre-existing ulcer in the stomach. Salicylic acid from dissociated bismuth subsalicylate adds to the anti-inflammatory actions of bismuth salts by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme and limiting the formation of prostaglandin, a pro-inflammatory mediator. Bismuth subsalicylate exhibits cytoprotective and demulcent activity, which makes it an effective drug in peptic ulcer disease.

They compete with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) for incorporation into folic acid. The action of sulfonamides exploits the difference between mammal cells and other kinds of cells in their folic acid metabolism. All cells require folic acid for growth. Folic acid (as a vitamin) diffuses or is transported into human cells. However, folic acid cannot cross bacterial (and certain protozoan) cell walls by diffusion or active transport. For this reason bacteria must synthesize folic acid from p-aminobenzoic acid.",

(The absolute bioavailability of cilazaprilat after oral administration of cilazaprilat is 19%.) Ingestion of food immediately before the administration of cilazapril reduces the average peak plasma concentration of cilazaprilat by 29%, delays the peak by one hour and reduces the bioavailability of cilazaprilat by 14%.

They are used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, since unlike most other mood altering drugs, they counteract both mania and depression. Lithium can also be used to augment other antidepressant drugs. It is also sometimes prescribed as a preventive treatment for migraine disease and cluster headaches. The active principle in these salts is the lithium ion Li+, which having a smaller diameter, can easily displace K+ and Na+ and even Ca+2, in spite of its greater charge, occupying their sites in several critical neuronal enzymes and neurotransmitter receptors.",

It is possible that Li+ produces its effects by interacting with the transport of monovalent or divalent cations in neurons. An increasing number of scientists have come to the conclusion that the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is the key factor in understanding how lithium works. Lithium has been shown to change the inward and outward currents of glutamate receptors (especially GluR3), without a shift in reversal potential. Lithium has been found to exert a dual effect on glutamate receptors, acting to keep the amount of glutamate active between cells at a stable, healthy level, neither too much nor too little.  It is postulated that too much glutamate in the space between neurons causes mania, and too little, depression. Another mechanism by which lithium might help to regulate mood include the non-competitive inhibition of an enzyme called inositol monophosphatase.  Alternately lithium's action may be enhanced through the deactivation of the GSK-3B enzyme.  The regulation of GSK-3B by lithium may affect the circadian clock.  GSK-3 is known for phosphorylating and thus inactivating glycogen synthase. GSK-3B has also been implicated in the control of cellular response to damaged DNA. GSK-3 normally phosphorylates beta catenin, which leads to beta catenin degratation. When GSK-3 is inhibited, beta catenin increases and transgenic mice with overexpression of beta catenin express similar behaviour to mice treated with lithium. These results suggest that increase of beta catenin may be a possible pathway for the therapeutic action of lithium. ",

The antiinflammatory actions of glucocorticoids are thought to involve phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, lipocortins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Paramethasone reduces inflammatory reaction by limiting the capillary dilatation and permeability of the vascular structures. These compounds restrict the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages and reduce the release of vasoactive kinins. Recent research suggests that corticosteroids may inhibit the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids, thereby reducing the formation of prostaglandins. Prednisolone is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist. On binding, the corticoreceptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing an increase or decrease in expression of specific target genes, including suppression of IL2 (interleukin 2) expression.",

Glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones characterised by an ability to bind with the cortisol receptor and trigger a variety of important cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic and homeostatic effects. Glucocorticoids are distinguished from mineralocorticoids and sex steroids by having different receptors, target cells, and effects. Technically, the term corticosteroid refers to both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, but is often used as a synonym for glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids suppress cell-mediated immunity. They act by inhibiting genes that code for the cytokines IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha, the most important of which is the IL-2. Reduced cytokine production limits T cell proliferation. Glucocorticoids also suppress humoral immunity, causing B cells to express lower amounts of IL-2 and IL-2 receptors. This diminishes both B cell clonal expansion and antibody synthesis. The diminished amounts of IL-2 also leads to fewer T lymphocyte cells being activated.",

            "summary": "Drospirenone is a synthetic progestin commonly found in the popular oral contraceptive, Yaz in combination with [Ethinyl estradiol].[L7973] Most recently, it was approved by both Health Canada and the FDA in combination with [Estetrol] as an oral contraceptive therapy.[L33199,L33174]  Aside from its contraceptive effects, drospirenone is used with estrogens to control acne and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).\r\n\r\nDrospirenone has been the subject of widespread safety concern due to the possibility of an increased risk of venous thromboembolism associated with its use.[A182543,A182552] In 2012, however, a safety statement by the FDA concluded that the increase in the risk of thromboembolism resulting from the use of drospirenone remains unclear, as studies regarding this risk are conflicting. Some studies have demonstrated a significantly increased risk and some demonstrating no risk of thromboembolic events.  In its statement, the FDA has mentioned that increased risk of venous thromboembolism with oral contraceptives such as drospirenone exists but remains lower than the risk of this condition during pregnancy and during the postpartum period, and this should be considered when assessing potential risks of hormonal contraceptive use.[L7979]",
            "indication": "Indication: Drospirenone, in combination with ethinyl estradiol or estetrol, is indicated as an oral contraceptive for the prevention of pregnancy.[L7973,L33174] In addition to its use for contraceptive effects, this combination is used to treat moderate acne vulgaris and the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder.[L7973,L7976]  The drug has approved indications for combination with estrogens for the treatment of menopause-associated symptoms, such as vasomotor symptoms and vulvovaginal atrophy. Drospirenone combined with estrogen may also may aid in the prevention of osteoporosis in women who have been post-menopausal for at least a year and are not candidates for other therapies.[L7997,L8075]   It can sometimes be found in preparations containing estrogen and folic acid for folic acid replenishment during oral contraception.[L8078]\r\n\r\nWhen used for the treatment of acne vulgaris, drospirenone-containing contraceptives should only be used in women \u226514 years of age who have experienced menarche, desire oral contraception, and do not have any contraindications to oral contraceptives.[L7976] Off-label uses for this drug include the treatment of menstrual irregularities, dysmenorrhea, hirsutism, and endometriosis.[A2439,A182576]",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol in combination suppress the release of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), preventing ovulation. Other changes induced by this drug which may aid in the prevention of pregnancy include alterations in cervical mucus consistency, hindering sperm movement, and lowering the chance of embryo implantation.[L7976]\r\n\r\nDrospirenone is an analog of the diuretic spironolactone, which exerts anti-mineralocorticoid activity, blocking aldosterone receptors, which increases sodium and water excretion.[A2439] Studies in animals have demonstrated that drospirenone administration leads to antiandrogenic activity. This activity helps to oppose the effects of naturally occurring androgens, inhibiting the binding of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to its receptor, and preventing androgen synthesis in the ovaries, helping to treat acne and hirsutism.[A2439,A182588,L7973] Drospirenone may also decrease the level of edema in sebaceous follicle during the second half of the menstrual cycle, when acne often appears.[L7973]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Drospirenone inhibits the maturation of follicles and inhibits ovulation, preventing pregnancy.  It has antiandrogen effects, improving acne and hirsutism. When combined with ethinyl estradiol, it has been shown to have favorable effects on the plasma lipid profile.[L7976] Due to its similarity to naturally occurring progesterone, drospirenone is thought to be associated with a lower incidence of progesterone contraceptive related adverse effects, such as breast tenderness and mood swings.[A2439]\r\n\r\n**A note on venous thromboembolism risk and antimineralcorticoid effects**\r\n\r\nAs with other oral contraceptives, the risk of venous thromboembolism and cardiovascular events may be increased when drospirenone is taken. The risk is especially higher in smokers and women aged 35 and older. Women taking this drug should be advised not to smoke. In addition, drospirenone, due to its antimineralcorticoid effects, may increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Patients at high risk for hyperkalemia should not be administered this drug.

Danazol also depresses the preovulatory surge in output of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), thereby reducing ovarian estrogen production. Danazol may also directly inhibits ovarian steroidogenesis; bind to androgen, progesterone, and glucocorticoid receptors; bind to sex-hormone-binding globulin and corticosteroid-binding globulin; and increases the metabolic clearance rate of progesterone. Another mechanism of action by which danazol may use to facilitate regression of endometriosis is by decreasing IgG, IgM, and IgA concentrations, as well as phospholipid and IgG isotope autoantibodies. In the treatment of endometriosis, as a consequence of suppression of ovarian function,  danazol causes both normal and ectopic endometrial tissues to become inactive and atrophic. This leads to anovulation and associated amenorrhea. In fibrocystic breast disease, the exact mechanism of action of danazol is unknown, but may be related to suppressed estrogenic stimulation as a result of decreased ovarian production of estrogen. A direct effect on steroid receptor sites in breast tissue is also possible. This leads to a disappearance of nodularity, relief of pain and tenderness, and possibly changes in the menstrual pattern. In terms of hereditary angioedema, danazol corrects the underlying biochemical deficiency by increasing serum concentrations of the deficient C1 esterase inhibitor, resulting in increased serum concentrations of the C4 component of the complement system.

The antiinflammatory actions of glucocorticoids are thought to involve phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, lipocortins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Ciclesonide reduces inflammatory reaction by limiting the capillary dilatation and permeability of the vascular structures. These compounds restrict the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages and reduce the release of vasoactive kinins. Recent research suggests that corticosteroids may inhibit the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids, thereby reducing the formation of prostaglandins. Ciclesonide is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist. On binding, the corticoreceptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing an increase or decrease in expression of specific target genes, including suppression of IL2 (interleukin 2) expression.",

Cefepime is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and has greater activity against both compared to third-generation antibiotics.[A2457,A249050] Cefepime is normally used to treat severe nosocomial pneumonia and infections caused by multi-resistant microorganisms such as _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, and is also indicated for the empirical treatment of febrile neutropenia.[A249050] The popularity of its third-generation predecessors, its clinical efficacy, and the high prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria might be some of the factors leading to an increase in the use of cefepime. The activity of cefepime against Enterobacteriaceae, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, and _Staphylococcus aureus_ is due to its high stability toward beta-lactamases.[A249050] In general, cefepime seems to be well tolerated; however, patients treated with this antibiotic, especially those with renal impairment, may develop neurotoxicity.[A249050,L42095,L42100]",
            "indication": "Indication: Cefepime is indicated for the treatment of pneumonia caused by susceptible bacteria, and for empiric therapy for febrile neutropenic patients. Cefepime is also indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated and complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) including pyelonephritis, uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, and complicated intra-abdominal infections (used in combination with [metronidazole]) in adults caused by susceptible bacteria.[L42095,L42100]\r\n\r\nCefepime is also used in combination with [enmetazobactam] to treat cUTI.[L50117]",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Cefepime is a bactericidal cephalosporin with a mode of action similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics.[L42095,L42100] Cefepime disrupts bacterial cell walls by binding and inhibiting transpeptidases known as penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which are enzymes involved in the final stages of peptidoglycan layer synthesis. This results in the lysis and death of susceptible microorganisms.[A249050] Cefepime has a broad spectrum of _in vitro_ activity that includes both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.[L42095,L42100] Cefepime has affinity for PBP-3 and PBP-1 in _Escherichia coli_ and _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, as well as PBP-2 in _E. coli_ and _Enterobacter cloacae_.[A249050]",

Whereas other cephalosporins are degraded by plasmid- and chromosome-mediated beta-lactamases, cefepime is stable and not significantly hydrolyzed by these enzymes.[A2457,A249050] Cefepime is also a poor inducer of type 1 beta-lactamases and, therefore, a good alternative against bacteria resistant to third-generation cephalosporins.[A2457] \r\n\r\nIn animal models of infection, the time that the unbound plasma concentration of cefepime exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of infecting organisms has been shown to correlate with treatment efficacy.[L42095,L42100] It has been suggested that cefepime can cross the inflamed blood-brain barrier.[L42095,L42100] This, along with its ability to inhibit \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), could lead to the neurotoxic effects observed in some of the patients treated with cefepime.[A249045,A249050]",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: Less than 1% of cefepime is metabolized in the liver.[A249045] Cefepime is metabolized to N-methylpyrrolidine (NMP), which then undergoes rapid oxidation to form NMP-N-oxide, a more stable compound.[L42095,L42100] NMP-N-oxide is the predominant metabolite of cefepime, while NMP and the 7-epimer of cefepime are minor byproducts.[A249040] It has been suggested that flavin-containing mixed-function oxygenase mediates the oxidation of NMP to NMP-N-oxide.[A249040]"

In women who have adequate endogenous estrogen, progesterone transforms a proliferative endometrium into a secretory one. Progesterone is essential for the development of decidual tissue and is necessary to increase endometrial receptivity for implantation of an embryo.

This increase in calcium and phosphorus levels occurs within three days following drug administration: this effect was reversed within three days of drug discontinuation. In patients with chronic renal failure, serum calcium levels were elevated while parathyroid hormone and alkaline phosphatase levels returned to normal levels within five days following alfacalcidol administration.[L33369] Since alfacalcidol suppresses parathyroid hormone, a reduction in parathyroid hormone levels is achieved more rapidly in patients on intermittent intravenous therapy, with significant reductions occurring within three months of therapy. In patients receiving daily oral therapy of alfacalcidol, the time it takes alfacalcidol to normalize plasma calcium levels may be up to several months, possibly reflecting calcium being utilized for bone mineralization.[L33284] In patients with nutritional osteomalacia, alfacalcidol increased calcium absorption with six hours of oral administration and the effects peaked at 24 hours.[L33369]",

(Merck Index, 11th ed) Internationally, diamorphine is controlled under Schedules I and IV of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. As heroin, it is illegal to manufacture, possess, or sell in the United States and the UK. However, under the name diamorphine, heroin is a legal prescription drug in the United Kingdom.",

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: When administered orally, diamorphine experiences extensive first-pass metabolism by way of deacetylation to generate the active metabolites 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and morphine [L4996, L4999]. Alternatively, when given as an injection the acetyl groups present in the diamorphine/diacetylmorphine compound confer the substance lipophilicity that facilitates diamorphine's rapid crossing of the blood-brain-barrier [L4996, L4999]. Once in the brain, diamorphine is metabolised via deacetylation to the active 6-MAM and morphine metabolites as well [L4996, L4999]. Despite diamorphine possessing little to no opioid agonist activity itself, its rapid transit across the blood-brain-barrier elicits a far faster onset of activity in comparison to the extensive first-pass metabolism of oral administration [L4996, L4999]. Regardless, the metabolism of diamorphine to morphine makes heroin a prodrug for the delivery of morphine [L4996, L4999].\r\n\r\nMorphine is subsequently a mu-opioid agonist. It acts on endogenous mu-opioid receptors that are spread in discrete packets throughout the brain, spinal cord and gut in almost all mammals [A2476]. Morphine, along with other opioids, are agonists to four endogenous neurotransmitters [A2476]. They are beta-endorphin, dynorphin, leu-enkephalin, and met-enkephalin [A2476]. The body responds to morphine in the brain by reducing (and sometimes stopping) production of the endogenous opioids when morphine is present [A2476]. Endorphins are regularly released in the brain and nerves, attenuating pain. Their other functions are still obscure, but are probably related to the effects produced by morphine besides analgesia (antitussin, anti-diarrheal) [A2476].\r\n\r\nNevertheless, morphine ultimately elicits the majority of its analgesic activity by binding to mu opioid receptors in both the central and peripheral nervous systems [L5005]. The overall effect of morphine is activation of descending inhibitory pathways of the central nervous system as well as inhibition of nociceptive afferent neurons of the peripheral nervous system, which results in an overall reduction of the nociceptive pain transmission [L5005]. ",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: The onset of heroin's effects is dependent on the method of administration. Taken orally, heroin is totally metabolized in vivo via extensive first-pass metabolism into morphine before crossing the blood-brain barrier; so the effects are the same as orally administered morphine [L4996, L4999]. Take by injection, diamorphine's acetyl groups facilitate rapid crossing into the brain [L4996, L4999]. Once in the brain, heroin is rapidly metabolized into morphine by removal of the acetyl groups, therefore making it a prodrug for the delivery of morphine [L4996, L4999]. Subsequently, whether eliciting actions peripherally (on smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, kidney, lung, liver, or spleen tissue [L4996], for example) or on the central nervous system, it is ultimately the morphine metabolite of heroin that then binds with opioid receptors and produces the narcotic opioid effects commonly associated with the substance [L4996, L4999].",

This inhibition of DAT blocks the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine into the presynaptic neuron, increasing the amount of dopamine in the synapse.

It is a necessary trace element in the diet, forming an essential part of many enzymes, and playing an important role in protein synthesis and in cell division. Zinc deficiency is associated with anemia, short stature, hypogonadism, impaired wound healing, and geophagia. It is identified by the symbol _Zn_ [L2098].\r\n\r\nA newer study suggests implies that an imbalance of zinc is associated with the neuronal damage associated with traumatic brain injury, stroke, and seizures [A32465].\r\n\r\n Understanding the mechanisms that control brain zinc homeostasis is, therefore, imperative to the development of preventive and treatment regimens for these and other neurological disorders [A32465].\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, recent review articles have already demonstrated the important role of zinc in the pathophysiology and treatment of affective disorders, plus discussed the potential value of zinc as a marker of these diseases [L2097].  Most recently, research has shown that polymorphism of the common polymorphism in zinc transporter _SLC30A8/ZnT8_ may increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes provided novel insights into the role of zinc in diabetes [A32416].",
            "indication": "Indication: Zinc can be used for the treatment and prevention of zinc deficiency/its consequences, including stunted growth and acute diarrhea in children, and slowed wound healing. It is also utilized for boosting the immune system, treating the common cold and recurrent ear infections, as well as preventing lower respiratory tract infections [L2172].  \r\n\r\n",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: **Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].\r\n\r\nZinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].\r\n\r\nIn HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].\r\n\r\nThere are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].\r\n\r\nZinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].\r\n\r\nThe change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. \r\n\r\nIn humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].\r\n\r\nIn another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].\r\n\r\nThe exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].\r\n\r\nStudies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:\r\n\r\n**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].\r\n\r\n**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. \r\n\r\n**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].\r\n",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: Zinc is released from food as free ions during its digestion. These freed ions may then combine with endogenously secreted ligands before their transport into the enterocytes in the duodenum and jejunum. [L2092]. Selected transport proteins may facilitate the passage of zinc across the cell membrane into the hepatic circulation. With high intake, zinc may also be absorbed through a passive paracellular route [L2092]. \r\n\r\nThe portal system carries absorbed zinc directly into the hepatic circulation, and then it is released into systemic circulation for delivery to various tissues. Although, serum zinc represents only 0.1% of the whole body zinc, the circulating zinc turns over rapidly to meet tissue needs [L2092]."

Special care should therefore be exercised when used in elderly patients, individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, and those with a history of asthma or significant allergies. Lincomycin for injection may contain benzyl alcohol as a preservative, which has been associated with gasping syndrome in pediatric patients.

Decline of estrogenic activity at the end of the menstrual cycle can bring on menstruation, although the cessation of progesterone secretion is the most important factor in the mature ovulatory cycle.

V2 receptors are predominantly expressed on the basolateral membrane of the distal tubule and collecting ducts of the kidney: these receptors are responsible for the antidiuretic effect of vasopressin, regulating water permeability of kidney tubules and therefore maintaining water homeostasis.[A2601] V3 receptors mediate the effects of vasopressin on the central nervous system.[A2605] \r\n\r\nVasopressin is considered a stress hormone as it is released into the bloodstream in response to various volume and pressure stimuli, such as pain, surgery, syncope and shock.[A2601, A2605, A252677] Shock conditions such as hypovolemia initially cause an increase in the release of vasopressin to maintain organ perfusion; however, as the shock state progresses, plasma vasopressin concentrations decrease due to several causes such as depleted stores of vasopressin in refractory shock and a central inhibitory effect of initially elevated vasopressin levels on further vasopressin release.[A2605]\r\n\r\nTerlipressin is a synthetic vasopressin analogue that can cause sustained increases in blood pressure in patients with shock conditions.[A2605] It exhibits twice the selectivity for vasopressin V1 receptors versus V2 receptors. Terlipressin is pharmacologically active but acts as a prodrug for [lypressin] (also known as lysine vasopressin), a vasoconstrictor and antidiuretic agent. The exact mechanism of action of terlipressin is not fully understood; however, terlipressin works to cause vasoconstriction in shock and other conditions associated with vasodilation. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is caused by splanchnic and systemic arterial vasodilation along with a reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cardiac output, resulting in a marked decrease in effective circulating volume.[A252672] Terlipressin is thought to increase renal blood flow in patients with HRS-1 by reducing portal hypertension and blood circulation in portal vessels and increasing effective arterial volume and mean arterial pressure (MAP).[L43217]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Terlipressin mimics the biological effects of endogenous vasopressin, but it displays increased selectivity for the V1 receptor and a longer half-life than vasopressin. These pharmacokinetic and molecular properties of terlipressin give it several advantages, such as the prevention of rebound hypotension when the drug is stopped [A2601, A2603] and convenience in patients with limited intravenous access.[A2601]\r\n\r\nTerlipressin increases arterial pressure (diastolic, systolic, and mean) and decreases heart rate in patients with hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS-1). After the administration of a single 0.85 mg dose of terlipressin in patients with HRS-1, cardiovascular effects were observed within five minutes after dosing and were maintained for at least six hours after dosing. The maximum change in blood pressure and heart rate occurred at 1.2 to two hours post-dose.[L43217]",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: The N-terminal glycyl residues of terlipressin is cleaved by various tissue peptidases to release its pharmacologically active metabolite, [lypressin] or lysine-vasopressin. Once formed, lypressin is undergoes various peptidase-mediated metabolic pathways in body tissues. Terlipressin is not metabolized in the blood or plasma. Due to the ubiquitous nature of peptidases in body tissues, it is unlikely that the metabolism of terlipressin will be affected by disease state or other drugs.[L43217]"

In contrast to ganglionic blocking agents, debrisoquin suppresses equally the responses mediated by alpha-and beta-adrenergic receptors but does not produce parasympathetic blockade. Since sympathetic blockade results in modest decreases in peripheral resistance and cardiac output, debrisoquin lowers blood pressure in the supine position.

In atrial fibrillation, tachyarrhythmia, or fast heart rate, can either be paroxysmal (less than 7 days) or persistent (more than 7 days). Atrial fibrillation causes turbulent and abnormal blood flow through the heart chambers, leading to decreased the effectiveness of the heart to pump blood and an increased likelihood of thrombus formation within the atria which can ultimately dislodge and cause a stroke.[L8980] \r\n\r\nDronedarone achieves heart rate and rhythm control in atrial fibrillation. _In vitro_, dronedarone decreased the maximum rate of the rise of an action potential in a concentration- and frequency-dependent manner.[A186071] Cardiac action potentials are generated by ionic currents of multiple voltage-gated ion channels, including potassium, sodium, and calcium channels.[A187129] Dronedarone is a multichannel blocker that meets the criteria of all four Vaughan Williams antiarrhythmic drug classes[A34604] but the contribution of each of these activities to the drug's antiarrhythmic effect is unknown.[L8699] Dronedarone inhibits rapid Na+ currents rate-dependently (class Ib), non-competitively antagonizes \u03b1\u2013 and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (class II), blocks K+ outward currents (class III) and blocks slow Ca2+ inward currents (class IV).[A34604] More specifically, it decreases delayed-rectifier K+ current (IKr), slowly activating delayed-rectifier K+ current (IKs), inward rectifier potassium current (IK1), peak Na+ current (INa) and L-type Ca2+ current (ICa (L)).[A186071,A186077] Dronedarone ultimately increases refractory periods, decelerates cardiac conduction, and prolongs cardiac action potential and refractory periods.[A34604,L8684]",

It reduces myocardial contractility with no change in left ventricular ejection fraction. Dronedarone vasodilates coronary arteries through activation of the nitric oxide pathway.[L8684] In clinical studies, dronedarone reduced incidence of hospitalizations for acute coronary syndromes and reduced incidence of stroke.[A186077] Dronedarone exhibits antiadrenergic effects by reducing alpha-adrenergic blood pressure response to epinephrine and beta 1 and beta 2 responses to isoproterenol.[L8684] \r\n\r\nDronedarone was shown to inhibit triiodothyronine (T3) signalling by binding to TR\u03b11 but much less so to TR\u03b21.[A187138] The treatment of dronedarone in patients with severe heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction was associated with increased early mortality related to the worsening of heart failure.[A186080] In animal studies, the use of dronedarone at doses equivalent to the recommended human doses was associated with fetal harm.

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) are incretin hormones that regulate blood glucose levels and maintain glucose homeostasis. It is estimated that the activity of GLP-1 and GIP contribute more than 70% to the insulin response to an oral glucose challenge. They stimulate insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner via G-protein-coupled GIP and GLP-1 receptor signalling. In addition to their effects on insulin secretion, GLP-1 is also involved in promoting islet neogenesis and differentiation, as well as attenuating pancreatic beta-cell apoptosis. Incretin hormones also exert extra-pancreatic effects, such as lipogenesis and myocardial function.[A232523] In type II diabetes mellitus, GLP-1 secretion is impaired, and the insulinotropic effect of GIP is significantly diminished.[A232488]\r\n\r\nVildagliptin exerts its blood glucose-lowering effects by selectively inhibiting dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), an enzyme that rapidly truncates and inactivates GLP-1 and GIP upon their release from the intestinal cells. DPP-4 cleaves oligopeptides after the second amino acid from the N-terminal end. Inhibition of DPP-4 substantially prolongs the half-life of GLP-1 and GIP, increasing the levels of active circulating incretin hormones.[A232523] The duration of DPP-4 inhibition by vildagliptin is dose-dependent.[A232533] Vildagliptin reduces fasting and prandial glucose and HbA1c. It enhances the glucose sensitivity of alpha- and beta-cells and augments glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Fasting and postprandial glucose levels are decreased, and postprandial lipid and lipoprotein metabolism are also improved.[A232488,A232528]",

Increased GLP-1 levels leads to enhanced sensitivity of alpha cells to glucose, promoting glucagon secretion. Vildagliptin causes an increase in the insulin to glucagon ratio by increasing incretin hormone levels: this results in a decrease in fasting and postprandial hepatic glucose production. Vildagliptin does not affect gastric emptying. It also has no effects on insulin secretion or blood glucose levels in individuals with normal glycemic control.[L32803]\r\n\r\nIn clinical trials, treatment with vildagliptin 50-100 mg daily in patients with type 2 diabetes significantly improved markers of beta-cells, proinsulin to insulin ratio, and measures of beta-cell responsiveness from the frequently-sampled meal tolerance test.

            "summary": "Milnacipran is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) and like many agents in this category was originally developed for and continues to be approved and indicated for the treatment of depression [F3928, F3934, A175786, A175951]. Furthermore, in 2009 the US FDA approved milnacipran for the additional indication of treating fibromyalgia [F3925], although other regional regulatory authorities like the EMA, among others, have not yet approved the agent for such treatment, citing lack of robust evidence of efficacy, insufficient demonstration of maintenance of effect, and other concerns [F3928, F3934]. Nevertheless, milnacipran demonstrates a somewhat unique characteristic among SNRIs to elicit a relatively balanced reuptake inhibition of both serotonin and noradrenaline, with a somewhat increased preference for noradrenaline reuptake inhibition - which is potentially a point of interest given the plausible proposal that noradrenaline plays an important role in the mitigation of pain signals in the descending inhibitory pain pathways in the brain and spinal cord [A175759, A175843, A175846].\r\n\r\nMoreover, recent research has shown that the levorotatory enantiomer of milnacipran, levomilnacipran, may have the capacity to inhibit the activity of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1), which has investigationally been associated with \u03b2-amyloid plaque formation - making the agent a possible course of treatment for Alzheimer's disease [A175957].",
            "indication": "Indication: Milnacipran is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) indicated for the management of fibromyalgia in patients that are 18 years old or above [F3925]. \r\n\r\nWhile milnacipran may be used for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), it is only recommended in adult patients who are 18 years old or above [F3922] due to an increased risk for suicidal ideation, thinking, and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults taking antidepressants for major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Some regional prescribing information notes that the use of the medication is specifically for the short-term symptomatic relief of MDD [F3919]. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the regulatory approval of and/or indications listed here for milnacipran may or may not exist and/or vary greatly between regions and nations [F3928, F3934].",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: The dual ability for milnacipran to inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin (5HT) and norepinephrine (NE) facilitates its treatment of both fibromyalgia and major depressive disorder (MDD).\r\n\r\nIn particular, it is generally believed that 5HT and NE participate in the modulation of endogenous analgesic mechanisms by way of the descending inhibitory pain pathways in the brain and spinal cord [A175759, A175843, A175846]. Although the specific mechanism of action remains unclear, some studies have proposed that low levels of 5HT may be associated with increased sensitivity to pain - a condition that could subsequently be improved by milnacipran's capacity to enhance the presence of 5HT by inhibiting its reuptake via serotonin transporters at synaptic clefts [A175846, F3937, L5659]. Furthermore, in the CNS it is also generally believed that NE released from descending pathways can mitigate pain sensations via eliciting inhibitory effects on alpha-2A-adrenoceptors on central terminals of primary afferent nociceptors, by direct alpha-2-adrenergic action on pain-relay neurons, and by alpha-1-adrenoceptor-mediated activation of inhibitory interneurons [A175843]. Such NE pain mitigation is consequently also enhanced by milnacipran's ability to enhance the presence of NE by inhibiting its reuptake via norepinephrine transporters at synaptic clefts [F3937].\r\n\r\nConcurrently, milnacipran's capacity to inhibit the reuptake of both 5HT and NE also facilitates its treatment of MDD. Given the monoamine hypothesis' assertion that decreased 5HT can be associated with anxiety, obsessions, compulsions, and decreased NE can result in lowered alertness, energy, attention, and general interest in life, it is proposed that milnacipran's basic activities as a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor could assist in treating such symptoms of MDD by increasing the presence of both 5HT and NE in the body by inhibiting their reuptake [A175840]. ",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: When utilized to treat fibromyalgia, the effect of milnacipran on the QTcF interval in patients was measured in a double-blind placebo-and positive-controlled parallel study in 88 healthy subjects using three to six times the recommended therapeutic dose for fibromyalgia at 600 mg/day [F3925]. After baseline and placebo adjustment, the maximum mean QTcF change was 8 ms - an increase that is generally not considered to be clinically significant [F3925].\r\n\r\nConversely, when used for treating major depressive disorder (MDD), non-clinical studies have shown that levomilnacipran binds with high affinity to the norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) transporters (Ki = 71-91 nM and 11 nM respectively at human transporters) [F3919, F3922, F3925]. Levomilnacipran inhibits the uptake of both NE and 5-HT in vitro and in vivo; preferentially inhibiting reuptake of NE over 5-HT by approximately 2-fold [F3919, F3922, F3925]. Levomilnacipran does not directly affect the uptake of dopamine or other neurotransmitters [F3919, F3922, F3925]. Levomilnacipran has no significant affinity for serotonergic (5-HT1-7), \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic, muscarinic (M1-5), histamine (H1-4), dopamine (D1-5), opiate, benzodiazepine, and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in vitro [F3919, F3922]. Levomilnacipran has no significant affinity for Ca++, K+, Na+, and Cl\u2013 channels and does not inhibit the activity of human monoamine oxidases (MAO-A and MAO-B) or acetylcholinesterase [F3919, F3922, F3925].\r\n\r\nMoreover, in ECG studies with levomilnacipran used to treat MDD, although no clinically significant changes in QTcF interval (QTcF=QT/RR0.33) were noted, it appears that the agent can cause increases in heart rate and blood pressure [F3919]. In particular, it appears that the maximum therapeutic dose of levomilnacipran at 120 mg/day is capable of causing a maximum mean difference in heart rate from placebo of 20.2 bpm and a mean difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure from placebo ranging from 3.8 to 7.2 mmHg and 6.1 to 8.1 mmHg, respectively [F3919]. Alternatively, a supratherapeutic dose of 300 mg/day is capable of causing a maximum mean difference in heart rate from placebo of 22.1 bpm and a mean difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure from placebo ranging from 5.4 to 7.9 mmHg and 7.9 to 10.6 mmHg, respectively [F3919].",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: It has been determined that levomilnacipran undergoes desethylation and hydroxylation to generate desethyl levomilnacipran and p-hydroxy-levomilnacipran, respectively [F3919, F3922, A175897]. Both oxidative metabolites undergo further conjugation with glucuronide to form the conjugate milnacipran carbamoyl-O-glucuronide [F3919, F3922, F3925, A175897]. The desethylation is catalyzed primarily by CYP3A4 with minor contribution by CYP2C8, 2C19, 2D6, and 2J2 [F3919, F3922]. Additionally, it is the general understanding that there is no interconversion between the enantiomers of milnacipran in the body [F3919, F3922, F3925, F3928]."

These channels (primarily Kv7.2/7.3) enable generation of the M-current, a sub-threshold potassium current that serves to stabilize the membrane potential and control neuronal excitability. In addition to acting on potassium ion channels, retigabine also affects GABA neurotransmission in the GABA-A receptor, which is a key inhibitory receptor in the central nervous system and is implicated in epilepsy. Malfunctioning of the GABA-A receptor leads to hyperexcitability in the brain, which causes seizures, making this receptor an important target for antiepileptic therapeutics. Apart from increasing the concentration of GABA in the brain (by either enhancing GABA synthesis or blocking GABA metabolism), retigabine allosterically potentiates GABA-induced current in rat cortical neurons in a concentration-dependent manner. Numerous studies have demonstrated that retigabine is effective in a broad spectrum of in vivo epilepsy and seizure models.",

Ezogabine is highly efficacious in a broad-spectrum of in vivo epilepsy and seizure models. A comparison of antiepileptic form activity of ezogabine with that of conventional anticonvulsants in in vitro models suggests that retigabine is especially likely to be useful in the treatment of pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Retigabine clearly attenuates pain-like behaviors in various animal models of neuropathic pain; it may also prove to be useful in treatment of clinical anxiety disorders. Clinical data obtained thus far indicate that retigabine is well tolerated in humans when titrated up to its therapeutic dose range. No tolerance, drug dependence, or withdrawal liability has been reported. Thus, retigabine may prove to be useful in the treatment of a diverse range of disease states in which neuronal hyperexcitability is a common underlying factor.",

In vitro studies have shown that indacaterol has more than 24-fold greater agonist activity at beta2-receptors compared to beta1-receptors and 20-fold greater agonist activity compared to beta3-receptors. This selectivity profile is similar to formoterol. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Bronchodilator drugs are the foundation for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The principal inhaled bronchodilator treatments used are \u03b2(2) -agonists and anticholinergics, either alone or in combination. Currently available \u03b2(2) -agonists are of either short duration and used multiple times/day, or of long duration, which requires twice-daily administration. Indacaterol is considered an ultra-long-acting \u03b2(2) -agonist and was recently approved for use in the United States. Its duration of action is approximately 24 hours, allowing for once-daily administration. Furthermore, this chiral compound it is given as the R-enantiomer and acts as a full agonist. Cough was the most commonly reported adverse effect with use of indacaterol. Compared to salmeterol, it has 35% more agonist activity. Cough usually occurred within 15 seconds of inhalation of the drug, lasted around 6 seconds, was not associated with bronchospasm, and did not cause discontinuation of the drug. Otherwise, the drug's safety profile was similar to that of other bronchodilators. [PMID: 22499359]",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: After oral administration of radiolabeled indacaterol, unchanged indacaterol was the main component in serum, accounting for about one third of total drug-related AUC over 24 hours. The monohydroxylated derivative, glucuronide conjugate, and the 8-O-glucuronide were the most prominent metabolites in serum. Other metabolites identified include a diastereomer of the hydroxylated derivative, a N-glucuronide of indacaterol, and C- and N-dealkylated products. \r\n\r\nIn vitro investigations indicated that UGT1A1 was the only UGT isoform that metabolized indacaterol to the phenolic O-glucuronide. CYP3A4 is the predominant isoenzyme responsible for hydroxylation of indacaterol."

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as Telaprevir. Telaprevir is an inhibitor of NS3/4A, a serine protease enzyme, encoded by HCV genotype 1 [FDA Label]. These enzymes are essential for viral replication and serve to cleave the virally encoded polyprotein into mature proteins like NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B. The barrier for develoment of resistance to NS3/4A inhibitors is lower than that of NS5B inhibitors, another class of DAAs [A19593]. Subtitutions at amino acid positions 155, 156, or 168 are known to confer resistance. The substitutions of the enzyme's catalytic triad consisting of H58, D82, and S139 are also likely to alter the affinity of the drug for NS3/4A or the activity of the enzyme itself.

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Tapentadol is a centrally-acting synthetic analgesic. Although their clinical relevance is unclear, tapentadol is believed to have two main mechanisms of action.[L47286] Tapentadol is a selective mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist: it binds to MOR with an affinity greater than or equal to ten-fold affinity compared to delta- and kappa-opioid receptors.[A36596] Tapentadol also inhibits noradrenaline reuptake, thereby increasing noradrenaline levels and activating alpha-2 receptors to promote analgesia.[A36596, A260731] Tapentadol is a weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor; however, this action does not contribute to its analgesic effect.[A36596]",

            "summary": "Silodosin is a selective antagonist of alpha(\u03b1)-1 adrenergic receptors that binds to the \u03b1<sub>1A</sub> subtype with the highest affinity. \u03b11-adrenergic receptors regulate smooth muscle tone in the bladder neck, prostate, and prostatic urethra: the \u03b1<sub>1A</sub> subtype accounts for approximately 75% of \u03b11-adrenoceptors in the prostate.[A231159] \r\n\r\nSilodosin was first approved by the FDA in October 2008 [A231159] and it is also approved in Europe and Canada. Silodosin is available as oral capsules with common trade names Rapaflo and Urorec. It is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia in adults.[L32368] Most commonly affecting males over the age of 40 years, benign prostatic hyperplasia is the non-malignant enlargement of the prostate gland, associated with lower urinary tract symptoms that have a negative impact on the quality of life of patients.[A231159] Silodosin works by binding to \u03b1<sub>1A</sub>-adrenoceptors with high affinity and relaxing the lower urinary tract, thereby improving urinary symptoms and alleviating bladder outlet obstruction.[A231229]",

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: The pathogenesis of benign prostatic hyperplasia is not fully understood: it is believed to involve several pathways, including inflammation, apoptosis, and cellular proliferation. Most drug therapies aim to alleviate symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia, silodosin included. Lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia are categorized into three main groups: voiding or obstructive (hesitancy, slow stream, intermittency, incomplete emptying), storage or irritative (frequency, urgency, nocturia, urge urinary incontinence), and postmicturition (postvoid dribbling). Prostate contraction is the main contributor to lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The smooth muscle tone of the prostate is regulated by \u03b1<sub>1A</sub>-adrenoceptors, which are the most highly expressed subtype of \u03b1<sub>1</sub>adrenoceptors in the human prostate tissue.[A231159] It has been reported that blockade of \u03b1<sub>1A</sub>-adrenoceptors relieves bladder outlet obstruction. Blockade of \u03b1<sub>1D</sub>-adrenoceptors, another subtype found in prostate tissue, is believed to alleviate storage symptoms due to detrusor overactivity.[A231229]\r\n\r\n\u03b1<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors are G protein-coupled receptors: upon binding of its natural ligand, norepinephrine and epinephrine, leads to the activation of phospholipase C and downstream signalling molecules, including inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol. Ultimately, there is an increase in intracellular calcium levels and, consequently, smooth muscle contraction. Silodosin is an antagonist of \u03b1<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors, with the highest selectivity for the \u03b1<sub>1A</sub>-adrenoceptor subtype. By blocking the \u03b1<sub>1A</sub>-adrenoceptor signalling pathway, silodosin promotes prostatic and urethral smooth muscle relaxation, thereby improving lower urinary tract symptoms such as voiding. Silodosin also targets afferent nerves in the bladder, relieving bladder overactivity and storage symptoms.[A231159]",

In clinical trials, silodosin improved maximum urinary flow rate, voiding symptoms, and storage symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia.[A231159, A231174] Following oral administration, silodosin had a rapid onset of effect in men,[A231174] with early effects of relieving lower urinary tract symptoms occurring within two to six hours post-dose.[A231229]\r\n\r\nSilodosin inhibited the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) tail current; however, it has weak cardiovascular effects.[A231199] As with all \u03b1<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonists blocking \u03b1<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors in the iris dilator muscle, silodosin may cause intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS), which is characterized by small pupils and iris billowing during cataract surgery in patients taking \u03b11-AR antagonists.[A231229]",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: The main metabolite of silodosin is silodosin glucuronide (KMD-3213G), which is a pharmacologically active metabolite formed by direct glucuronide conjugation mediated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B7 (UGT2B7). Silodosin glucuronide reaches plasma exposure (AUC) approximately four times greater than that of silodosin. The second major metabolite, KMD-3293, is formed from dehydrogenation catalyzed by alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases. KMD-3293 has negligible pharmacological activity and reaches plasma exposures similar to that of silodosin. Silodosin is also metabolized by CYP3A4, which catalyzes the oxidation reaction.[L32368]\r\n\r\nOther than glucuronidation, dehydrogenation, and oxidation as its main metabolic pathways, silodosin can also undergo dealkylation (KMD-3289), N-dealkylation, hydroxylation, glucosylation, and sulfate conjugation.

Amisulpride has no affinity for serotonin, alpha-adrenergic, H1-histamine, cholinergic, and sigma receptors. In clinical trials, amisulpride improved reduced secondary negative symptoms, affective symptoms, and psychomotor retardation in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. Notably, amisulpride has a differential target binding profile at different doses: at low doses, amisulpride selectively binds to presynaptic dopamine autoreceptors. At high doses, it preferentially binds to post-synaptic dopamine receptors.[A6753] This explains how amisulpride reduces negative symptoms at low doses and mediates antipsychotic effects at high doses.[L32764] One study alluded that the antinociceptive effects of amisulpride are mediated through opioid receptor acvitation and D2 receptor antagonism.

            "summary": "Simeprevir is a hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease inhibitor indicated in patient's with HCV genotype 1 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Like all NS3/4A inhibitors, simeprevir is a serine protease inhibitor in similarity to [DB08873] and [DB05521] but is classified as a second generation protease inhibitor. This class of antiviral drugs were the first direct acting antivirals approved but are associated with lower cure rates than newer drugs. Broad use of simeprevir occurred when it was used in combination with a newer drug, [DB08934]. Inhibiting HCV NS3/4A protease in a potent and highly specific manner, simeprevir is a direct-acting antiviral agent against the hepatitis C virus. Since the viral protease NS3/4A complex is essential for cleaving the HCV encoded polyprotein into individual viral proteins facilitating replication [A19632], the drug blocks the viral replication process. It is shown to display synergistic effects with interferon-\u03b1 and HCV NS5B inhibitor, and additive effects with ribavirin in HCV replicon cells [A19629]. Unlike first generation serine protease inhibitors, simprevir has a sightly different resistance profile where limited therapeutic efficacy of the drug is observed with NS3 Q80K polymorphic variants and simeprevir-specific amino acid position of 168 also results in higher treatment failure rates [A19630]. The observed prevalence of the N3 Q80K polymorphism was 30% in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1a and 0.5% in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1b [A19630]. \r\n\r\nAccording to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and 2015 consensus guidelines from the Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver (CASL), simeprevir can be used as first-line or second-line threapies for treatment-na\u00efve patients as adjunct to sofosbuvir treatment for genotype 1 or PEG-Interferon/ribavirin combination therapy for genotype 1 or 4. The combination therapy of simeprevir and other antiviral agents are initiated in HCV-positive patients with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626].\r\n\r\nSimeprevir was approved by the FDA in November 2014 and is marketed under the brand name Olysio as oral tablets. Administered once daily with food, 150mg simeprevir capsule is used in combination with [DB08934] in patients with HCV genotype 1 without cirrhosis for 12 week duration. In patients with HCV genotype 1 with compensated cirrhosis, the treatment is directed for 24 week duration. Sustained virologic response 12 weeks after planned end of treatment (SVR12) was achieved in 170/176 (97%) subjects without cirrhosis treated with 12 weeks simeprevir in combination with sofosbuvir (FDA Label). The overall SVR12 was 88% (44/50) in treatment-na\u00efve patients with cirrhosis [L852].\r\n\r\nSimeprevir is also used in treatment of HCV genotype 4 patients with or without cirrhosis and is taken with [DB00008] and [DB00811]; this triple therapy allows shortening treatment duration from 48 weeks or longer to 12 or 24 weeks [A19630] depending on prior response status and presence of HIV-1 co-infection. Prior to initiation of treatment with [DB00008] and [DB00811], screening for the presence of virus with the NS3 Q80K polymorphism is strongly recommended and if detected, alternative treatment should be considered instead to prevent therapeutic failure. The SVR12 was 83% (29/35) in treatment-na\u00efve patients and 86% (19/22) in relapsing patients.",

Simeprevir exerts an inhibitory action on HCV polyprotein cleavage via induced-fit binding to an extended S2 subsite located in the NS3 catalytic site [A19633]. NS3/4A inhibitors usually depend on few interactions located in the substrate binding groove of the viral serine protease, thus are susceptible to resistance and failed treatment from few critical mutations in these sites. \r\nAt higher concentration above their antiviral half-maximal effective concentration (EC50), simeprevir and other NS3/4A inhibitors also restore interferon (IFN)-signaling pathways that are thought to be disrupted by NS3/4A protease and recover innate immune processes. NS3/4A protease cleaves two essential adaptor proteins that initiate signaling leading to activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 synthesis, which are mitochondrial antiviral-signaling proteins (MAVS otherwise known as IPS-1, VISA, or Cardif) and toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)- domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-\u03b2 (TRIF).

            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Dapagliflozin also reduces sodium reabsorption and increases the delivery of sodium to the distal tubule. This may influence several physiological functions including, but not restricted to, lowering both pre- and afterload of the heart and downregulation of sympathetic activity, and decreased intraglomerular pressure which is believed to be mediated by increased tubuloglomerular feedback.[L48246]\r\n\r\nIncreases in the amount of glucose excreted in the urine were observed in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus following the administration of dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin doses of 5 or 10 mg per day in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for 12 weeks resulted in excretion of approximately 70 grams of glucose in the urine per day at Week 12. A near-maximum glucose excretion was observed at the dapagliflozin daily dose of 20 mg. This urinary glucose excretion with dapagliflozin also results in increases in urinary volume. After discontinuation of dapagliflozin, on average, the elevation in urinary glucose excretion approaches baseline by about 3 days for the 10 mg dose.[L48246]\r\n\r\nDapagliflozin was not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of QTc interval at daily doses up to 150 mg (15 times the recommended maximum dose) in a study of healthy subjects.

DPP-4 inhibitors are a class of compounds that work by affecting the action of natural hormones in the body called incretins. Incretins decrease blood sugar by increasing consumption of sugar by the body, mainly through increasing insulin production in the pancreas, and by reducing production of sugar by the liver. [Bristol-Myers Squibb Press Release]\r\nDPP-4 is a membrane associated peptidase which is found in many tissues, lymphocytes and plasma. DPP-4 has two main mechanisms of action, an enzymatic function and another mechanism where DPP-4 binds adenosine deaminase, which conveys intracellular signals via dimerization when activated. Saxagliptin forms a reversible, histidine-assisted covalent bond between its nitrile group and the S630 hydroxyl oxygen on DPP-4. The inhibition of DPP-4 increases levels active of glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which inhibits glucagon production from pancreatic alpha cells and increases production of insulin from pancreatic beta cells.\r\n",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Post-administration of saxagliptin, GLP-1 and GIP levels rise up to 2- to 3- fold. Because it is very selective of DPP-4 inhibition, there are fewer systemic side effects. Saxagliptin inhibits DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. It also decreased glucagon concentrations and increased glucose-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) is 0.5 nmol/L.  Saxagliptin did not prolong the QTc interval to a clinically significant degree. ",

Activation of \u03b1-adrenergic receptors leads to vasoconstriction of the blood vessels of the nasal mucosa and resumption of nasal airflow.[A228533] As the most abundantly expressed in the human nasal mucosa, \u03b1<sub>1A</sub>- and \u03b1<sub>2B</sub>-adrenoceptors may play the most important role in vasoconstriction of the human nasal mucosa.

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Hemostasis is a complex process that balances coagulation to prevent excessive thrombus formation or excessive bleeding. Central to the coagulation process is the serine protease thrombin (FIIa), which is synthesized as inactive prothrombin (FII) and subsequently activated by FXa/FVa, leading to a positive feedback loop and the production of large quantities of thrombin; once enough thrombin is formed, it cleaves soluble fibrinogen to form insoluble fibrin fibres that, together with aggregated platelets, form a clot. Although beneficial in wound healing, aberrant thrombus formation can lead to serious health consequences.[A236205]\r\n\r\nDabigatran is a univalent reversible direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI) that competitively inhibits thrombin with a K<sub>i</sub> of 4.5 \u00b1 0.2 nmol/L.[A236200, A236210, L34675, L34680] Furthermore, the reversible nature of the inhibition is believed to allow for some normal physiological thrombin function, which may help alleviate some adverse effects associated with anticoagulation therapy.[A236215] In addition, dabigatran has several glucuronidated metabolites, all of which have been shown to possess _in vitro_ activity similar to the parent compound.[A17924]\r\n\r\nIn addition to a direct effect on thrombin activity, dabigatran has also been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation, another step in the coagulation pathway. However, the mechanism remains unclear as dabigatran inhibits platelet aggregation stimulated by thrombin and von Willebrand factor (vWF), but not by other pathways such as ADP- or thromboxane A2-induced aggregation.[A236210, A236220, A215227, L34675, L34680]",

Premature discontinuation of dabigatran, in the absence of an alternative anticoagulant, also carries an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Due to the risk of an epidural or spinal hematoma, dabigatran should generally not be used in the context of neuraxial anesthesia or spinal puncture; if such use is unavoidable, careful monitoring should be employed. Dabigatran should not be used in patients with prosthetic heart valves due to an increased occurrence of major bleeding and thromboembolic events. Dabigatran is a substrate of the P-gp transporter and should generally not be administered together with P-gp inhibitors or inducers, especially in patients with impaired renal function.

Dabigatran etexilate can also first undergo CES1-mediated hydrolysis to BIBR1087 (M1) followed by CES2-mediated hydrolysis to [dabigatran], though it is hypothesized that the former pathway accounts for most of the active form in plasma.[A17923, A236195] Dabigatran can undergo 1-_O_-acyl glucuronidation by UGT1A9, UGT2B7, and UGT2B15 followed by acyl migration to form the corresponding 2-_O_-, 3-_O_-, and 4-_O_-acyl glucuronides; all of these acyl glucuronides exhibit activity similar to [dabigatran] but account for a small fraction of recovered metabolites.[A236225, A17924, L34675, L34680]\r\n\r\nIn addition to these better characterized metabolic pathways, detailed LC/MS characterization suggests a wide variety of possible metabolites following oral or intravenous administration, most of which are present in only trace amounts in plasma, urine, or feces.

M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is thought to result from a disruption of endolymphatic fluid homeostasis in the ear.[A220438] Betahistine mainly acts as a histamine H1-receptor agonist. The stimulation of H1-receptors in the inner ear causes a vasodilatory effect leading to increased permeability of blood vessels and a reduction in endolymphatic pressure; this action prevents the rupture of the labyrinth, which can contribute to the hearing loss associated with  M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. Betahistine is also purported to act by reducing the asymmetrical functioning of sensory vestibular organs and increasing vestibulocochlear blood flow, relieving symptoms of vertigo.[A220433]\r\n\r\n**H3-receptor activity**\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above mechanisms, betahistine also acts as a histamine H3-receptor antagonist, increasing the turnover of histamine from postsynaptic histaminergic nerve receptors, subsequently leading to an increase in H1-agonist activity. H3-receptor antagonism elevates levels of neurotransmitters including serotonin in the brainstem, inhibiting the activity of vestibular nuclei, thus restoring proper balance and decreasing vertigo symptoms.[A220328]",

Activation of M<sub>3</sub> receptors results in ASM contraction and resulting bronchoconstriction through downstream calcium-dependent signalling pathways, while M<sub>2</sub> activation inhibits neuronal acetylcholine release.[A229603, A229613, A229618]\r\n\r\nMethacholine is a non-specific mAChR agonist, capable of acting on all mAChR subtypes.[A229623, A229628, A229633] However, in the context of AHR, methacholine's ability to induce bronchoconstriction through M<sub>3</sub> receptors is clinically relevant.[A229603, A229618, A229643] In addition, M<sub>3</sub> agonism may increase the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, further contributing to AHR.[A17070] The inhibitory effect of M<sub>2</sub> agonism by methacholine is likely also important, as shown by animal studies using mice with impaired M<sub>2</sub> function, and by observations that eosinophilic inflammation, such as occurs in asthma, negatively impacts M<sub>2</sub> function.[A229613] Hence, asthmatic patients are more sensitive to inhaled cholinergic agonists such as methacholine; this forms the basis for the methacholine challenge test, which diagnoses AHR through an increased methacholine-induced response.[A229648, L31763]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Methacholine is a non-specific cholinergic agonist (parasympathomimetic) that acts through muscarinic receptors in the lungs to induce bronchoconstriction, which is more significant in patients with asthma than those without. Therefore, methacholine carries a risk of severe bronchoconstriction, especially in patients with pre-existing reduced pulmonary function (typically baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> < 60% or < 1.5 L, at least in adults), clinically apparent asthma or wheezing, or other health conditions such as uncontrolled hypertension, aortic aneurysm, or history of myocardial infarction or stroke. Use in patients with epilepsy, vagotonia, peptic ulcer disease, thyroid disease, urinary tract obstruction or other conditions that could be adversely affected by a cholinergic agent is not recommended. Also, there is a potential risk to healthcare workers administering the methacholine challenge test; proper precautions and protective equipment should be used as needed.[L31763]",

DHT binds to the same androgen receptor even more strongly than T, so that its androgenic potency is about 2.5 times that of T. The T-receptor or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows it to move into the cell nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA.

These stem cells are then collected and used in autologous stem cell transplantation to replace blood-forming cells destroyed by chemotherapy.[A7118,L45678] \r\n\r\nAs an inhibitor of CXCR4, plerixafor blocks the binding of its ligand, stromal cell-derived factor-1-alpha (SDF-1\u03b1). Since CXCR4 and SDF-1\u03b1 are involved in the trafficking and homing of CD34+ cells to the marrow compartment, blocking this interaction leads to an increase in CD34+ cell circulating levels.[A7117] Compared to placebo with G-CSF, the plerixafor and G-CSF mobilization regimen has a higher probability of achieving the optimal CD34+ cell target for tandem transplantation in fewer apheresis procedures.[A7115] \r\n\r\nPlerixafor has orphan drug status in the United States and European Union and was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on December 15, 2008.[A7117,L45678]",

SDF-1\u03b1 and CXCR4 play a role in the trafficking and homing of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to the marrow compartment. In the marrow, stem cell CXCR4 can help anchor HSCs to the marrow matrix, either directly via SDF-1\u03b1 or through the induction of other adhesion molecules. By blocking the interaction between SDF-1\u03b1 and CXCR4 with plerixafor, the mobilization of progenitor cells is triggered. Adding granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to enhance CD34+ cell mobilization increases the yield of stem cells, an important determinant of graft adequacy.[A7113,A7114,L45678]",

In combination with a granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), circulating CD34+ cells in the peripheral blood peaked between 10 and 14 hours. The use of plerixafor is not associated with QT/QTc prolongation at single doses up to 0.40 mg/kg.[L45678]\r\n\r\nSerious hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylactic-type reactions, have occurred in patients receiving plerixafor. The use of plerixafor may also cause tumor cell mobilization in leukemia patients, splenic enlargement and rupture, embryo-fetal toxicity, and hematologic effects, such as leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia. When used in combination with G-CSF for hematopoietic stem cell mobilization\u201a plerixafor may lead to the release of tumor cells from the marrow and their subsequent collection in the leukapheresis product.[L45678]",

This is consistent with the presence of two cyclam rings in plerixafor, which may act as potential chelating sites.[L45713]"

As cancer cells are rapidly replicating, they require a lot of folates to accommodate an accelerated cell division and DNA and protein modification for cellular transformation.[A246654, A246659] Therefore, interruption with folate metabolism can inhibit tumor growth.[L37674]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, pralatrexate also undergoes polyglutamylation catalyzed by folyopolyglutamate synthase (FPGS).[L37674] This reaction both increases cellular retention of pralatrexate for extended drug action and impedes the uptake of folate, also a substrate of FPGS, to further inhibit folate metabolism in cancer cells.[A5138]\r\n",

As a result, pralatrexate is more cytotoxic and better retained in cancer cells.[A246693]\r\n\r\nDue to its anti-folate activity, pralatrexate's main toxicity is manifested as mucositis that can require dose interruption or reduction[A246693,L41559].

It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on January 31, 2012[L768], and by Health Canada in late 2012.[L6841]  Ivacaftor is administered as a monotherapy and also administered in combination with other drugs for the management of CF.[L6814,L6979,L6847]\r\n\r\nCystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by one of several different mutations in the gene for the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein, an ion channel involved in the transport of chloride and sodium ions across cell membranes. CFTR is active in epithelial cells of organs such as of the lungs, pancreas, liver, digestive system, and reproductive tract. Alterations in the CFTR gene result in altered production, misfolding, or function of the protein and consequently abnormal fluid and ion transport across cell membranes.[A20298, A20299] As a result, CF patients produce thick, sticky mucus that clogs the ducts of organs where it is produced making patients more susceptible to complications such as infections, lung damage, pancreatic insufficiency, and malnutrition.[A20302]\r\n\r\nPrior to the development of ivacaftor, management of CF primarily involved therapies for the control of infections, nutritional support, clearance of mucus, and management of symptoms rather than improvements in the underlying disease process or lung function (FEV1). Notably, ivacaftor was the first medication approved for the management of the underlying causes of CF (abnormalities in CFTR protein function) rather than control of symptoms.[A20297]",
            "indication": "Indication: When used as monotherapy as the product Kalydeco, ivacaftor is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged one month and older who have one mutation in the CFTR gene that is responsive to ivacaftor potentiation based on clinical and/or _in vitro_ assay data.[L41320, L46337]\r\n\r\nWhen used in combination with the drug [lumacaftor] as the product Orkambi, ivacaftor is indicated for the management of CF in patients aged one year and older who are homozygous for the _F508del_ mutation in the CFTR gene. If the patient\u2019s genotype is unknown, an FDA-cleared CF mutation test should be used to detect the presence of the _F508del_ mutation on both alleles of the CFTR gene.[L43060]\r\n\r\nWhen used in combination with [tezacaftor] in the product Symdeko, it is used to manage CF in patients 12 years and older who have at least one mutation in the CFTR gene or patients aged 12 or older who are shown to be homozygous for the F508del mutation.[L6814]\r\n\r\nWhen used in combination with tezacaftor and [elexacaftor] in the product Trikafta, it is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients 12 years of age and older who have at least one _F508del_ mutation in the CFTR gene.[L9395]",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: A wide variety of CFTR mutations correlate to the Cystic Fibrosis phenotype and are associated with differing levels of disease severity. The most common mutation, affecting approximately 70% of patients with CF worldwide, is known as F508del-CFTR or delta-F508 (\u0394F508), in which a deletion in the amino acid phenylalanine at position 508 results in impaired production of the CFTR protein, thereby causing a significant reduction in the amount of ion transporter present on cell membranes.[A20301] Ivacaftor as monotherapy has failed to show a benefit for patients with delta-F508 mutations, most likely due to an insufficient amount of protein available at the cell membrane for interaction and potentiation by the drug.[A20305] The next most common mutation, G551D, affecting 4-5% of CF patients worldwide is characterized as a missense mutation, whereby there is sufficient amount of protein at the cell surface, but opening and closing mechanisms of the channel are altered.[A17564] Ivacaftor is indicated for the management of CF in patients with this second type of mutation, as it binds to and potentiates the channel opening ability of CFTR proteins on the cell membrane.[A17564]\r\n\r\nIvacaftor exerts its effect by acting as a potentiator of the CFTR protein, an ion channel involved in the transport of chloride and sodium ions across cell membranes of the lungs, pancreas, and other organs. Alterations in the CFTR gene result in altered production, misfolding, or function of the protein and consequently abnormal fluid and ion transport across cell membranes [A20298, A20299]. Ivacaftor improves CF symptoms and underlying disease pathology by potentiating the channel open probability (or gating) of CFTR protein in patients with impaired CFTR gating mechanisms. The overall level of ivacaftor-mediated CFTR chloride transport is dependent on the amount of CFTR protein at the cell surface and how responsive a particular mutant CFTR protein is to ivacaftor potentiation [L6979].",

            "summary": "Azilsartan medoxomil is a prodrug that is broken down to azilsartan, which belongs in the angiotensin-receptor blocking (ARB) drug class. It is a selective AT1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Azilsartan medoxomil is a relatively recently-developed antihypertensive drug that was first approved by the FDA in February 2011.[A7354] Many guidelines recommend the use of ARBs as first-line therapy when initiating antihypertensive therapy and indicate that the clinical efficacy of ARBs is comparable to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors that are also used as first-line treatment for hypertension.[A232863]\r\n\r\nAzilsartan medoxomil is marketed under the brand name Edarbi. It is used to treat hypertension as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs. It is also available in a combination product with [chlorthalidone]. As hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease,[A7354] early management of hypertension has several implications on patients' survival rate and quality of life in the future. Lowering blood pressure is associated with a reduced risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.[L32918] Azilsartan medoxomil is thus speculated to lower mortality rates and the onset of cardiovascular disease. Although there is no clinical significance yet determined, azilsartan medoxomil may have potential off-label uses in patients with a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure.[A232863]",
            "indication": "Indication: Azilsartan medoxomil is indicated for the treatment of hypertension to lower blood pressure in patients over 18 years of age. It may be used either alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Some antihypertensive drugs have lesser effects on blood pressure in black patients.[L32918]\r\n\r\nAzilsartan medoxomil is available as a fixed-dose combination product with [chlorthalidone], which is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in patients whose hose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on monotherapy. It may be used as initial therapy if a patient is likely to need multiple drugs to achieve blood pressure goals.[L32923]\r\n\r\nAzilsartan medoxomil belongs to the angiotensin-receptor blocking (ARB) class of drugs, which are used to decrease the progression of moderate-to-severe albuminuria and prevent the recurrence of atrial fibrillation as off-label uses in patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension.[A232863]",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system regulates blood pressure. Angiotensin II is a peptide hormone that is a principal pressor agent in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.[A7354] It is a potent, direct vasoconstrictor that binds to the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1 receptor) to stimulate the synthesis and release of aldosterone and promote cardiac stimulation. Angiotensin II promotes renal tubular reabsorption of sodium, resulting in water retention.[A7354,L32918] It also inhibits further secretion of renin. AT1 receptors are highly expressed in vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland.[A232863]\r\n\r\nAzilsartan medoxomil is a prodrug that is hydrolyzed to its active metabolite, azilsartan, in the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration. Azilsartan selectively binds to AT1 receptors as an antagonist, blocking vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II. Azilsartan has more than a 10,000-fold greater affinity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor, which is predominantly involved in cardiovascular homeostasis.[L32918] Azilsartan appears to dissociate from AT1 receptors much more slowly than other ARBs,[A7356] which explains its longer duration of action when compared to other ARBs.[A232870]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Pharmacodynamic effects of azilsartan medoxomil are mediated by its active metabolite, azilsartan. Azilsartan inhibits the pressor effects of an angiotensin II infusion in a dose-related manner.[A7354] At a single 32 mg dose, azilsartan inhibited the maximal pressor effect by approximately 90% at peak plasma concentrations and by 60% at 24 hours after administration. In healthy subjects receiving single and repeated doses of azilsartan medoxomil, plasma angiotensin I and II concentrations and plasma renin activity increased, while plasma aldosterone concentrations decreased.[L32918] Like other ARBs, azilsartan causes dose-dependent decrease in peripheral resistance and decreases smooth muscle vascular tone.[A232870] As azilsartan blocks the angiotensin II receptor, the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion is inhibited; however, the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the blood pressure-lowering effect of azilsartan. Blood pressure-lowering effects of antihypertensive agents can be reduced in patients of African descent.[L32918] However, there are no recommended dosage adjustment of azilsartan on the basis of a patient\u2019s sex, race, or degree of renal or hepatic impairment.[A232910]\r\n\r\nAzilsartan medoxomil has negligible effects on serum potassium or sodium levels. Azilsartan does not affect the biosynthesis of angiotensin II nor bradykinin levels. It also does not bind to any ion channels that are involved in cardiovascular regulation.[L32918] ",
            "metabolism": "Metabolism: After azilsartan medoxomil is hydrolyzed into its active metabolite, azilsartan is metabolized to two primary metabolites, which are pharmacologically inactive. The major metabolite in plasma is metabolite M-II, which is formed via O-dealkylation mediated by CYP2C9. The minor metabolite is metabolite M-I, which is formed via decarboxylation mediated by CYP2C8 and CYP2B6. MII has approximately 50% systemic exposure of azilsartan, and MI has less than 1% systemic exposure of azilsartan.[A232910,L32918]"

Tauroursodeoxycholic acid lowers the bile cholesterol saturation in the gallbladder, thereby increasing the solubility of cholesterol in bile. It can also maintain a specific gut microbiota composition to promote the synthesis of bile acids and reduce liver inflammation caused by the lipopolysaccharide in the blood.

This is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as \"bad cholesterol\"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]\r\n\r\nPitavastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]\r\n\r\nWhile all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels.[A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Study data has confirmed that pitavastatin's potency in lowering LDL-C is comparable to that of other statins but also has increased efficacy in increasing HDL-C (also known as \"good cholesterol\").[A182000,A182003,A182006] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181538, A181427]",
            "indication": "Indication: Pitavastatin is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia to reduce elevated total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), triglycerides (TG), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). It is also indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 8 years and older with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) to reduce elevated TC, LDL-C, and Apo B.[L48616]\r\n\r\nPrescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]",
            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Pitavastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421] Pitavastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increase hepatic uptake of LDL, thereby reducing circulating LDL-C levels. \r\n\r\nIn vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that statins exert vasculoprotective effects independent of their lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.\r\n\r\nStatins have also been found to bind allosterically to \u03b22 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.[A181559]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Pitavastatin is an oral antilipemic agent which inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A181087, A181406]\r\n\r\nElevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]\r\n\r\n**Skeletal Muscle Effects**\r\n\r\nPitavastatin may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above ten times the upper limit of normal) and rhabdomyolysis (with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria). Rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statin use, including pitavastatin. Predisposing factors for myopathy include advanced age (\u226565 years), female gender, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. In most cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when treatment was promptly discontinued. As dosages of pitavastatin greater than 4mg per day were associated with an increased risk of severe myopathy, the product monograph recommends a maximum daily dose of 4mg once daily.[L48616]\r\n\r\nThe risk of myopathy during treatment with pitavstatin may be increased with concurrent administration of interacting drugs such as [fenofibrate], [niacin], [gemfibrozil], and [cyclosporine].  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[L48616]\r\n\r\nReal-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]\r\n\r\n**Hepatic Dysfunction**\r\n\r\nIncreases in serum transaminases have been reported with pitavastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and either resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including pitavastatin.[L48616]\r\n\r\nPatients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury.[L48616]\r\n\r\n**Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels**\r\n\r\nIncreases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statins, including pitavastatin.

Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as Boceprevir. Boceprevir is an inhibitor of NS3/4A, a serine protease enzyme, encoded by HCV genotypes 1 and 4 [synthesis]. These enzymes are essential for viral replication and serve to cleave the virally encoded polyprotein into mature proteins like NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B [FDA Label]. The barrier for develoment of resistance to NS3/4A inhibitors is lower than that of NS5B inhibitors, another class of DAAs [A19593]. Subtitutions at amino acid positions 155, 156, or 168 are known to confer resistance. The substitutions of the enzyme's catalytic triad consisting of H58, D82, and S139 are also likely to alter the affinity of the drug for NS3/4A or the activity of the enzyme itself. Despite this disadvantage Boceprevir is still effective against HCV when paired with [DB00811], [DB00008], and [DB00022].\r\n\r\nIn a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) do not reccomend Boceprevir in combination with [DB00811], [DB00008], and [DB00022] as first line therapy for Hepatitis C [A19593].

Both compounds mediate a bactericidal activity against _C. difficile_ by inhibiting bacterial RNA polymerase at the initiation phase of the transcription cycle.[A190486] The RNA polymerase is an essential bacterial enzyme that regulates gene expression, catalyzes nucleic acid interactions, and promotes several bacterial enzymatic reactions critical for bacterial survival.[A190486] The core RNA polymerase is composed of a complex of different subunits and contains the active site.[A190531] To initiate bacterial transcription, the active site of the core RNA polymerase binds to a promoter-specificity \u03c3 initiation factor, which locates and binds to a promoter region of the DNA. The DNA-RNA polymerase interaction promotes subsequent steps of transcription, which involves the separation of DNA strands.[A7444] Fidaxomicin binds to the DNA template-RNA polymerase complex, thereby preventing the initial separation of DNA strands during transcription and inhibiting messenger RNA synthesis.[A190486] The narrow spectrum of antimicrobial activity of fidaxomicin may be explained by the unique target site of fidaxomicin and differing \u03c3 subunits of the core structure of RNA polymerase among bacterial species.[A190486] ",

            "summary": "Ruxolitinib, formerly known as INCB018424 or INC424, is an anticancer drug and a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. It is a potent and selective inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2,[A229698] which are tyrosine kinases involved in cytokine signalling and hematopoiesis.[A7450] Myeloproliferative neoplasms, such as myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera, are often characterized by aberrant activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, leading to abnormal blood cell counts and thrombotic complications. By inhibiting JAK1 and JAK2, ruxolitinib works to block the dysregulated cell signalling pathways and prevents abnormal blood cell proliferation.[A229708] Due to a large number of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms who have JAK2 mutations, ruxolitinib was the first ATP-competitive inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 ever developed.[A229938]\r\n\r\nRuxolitinib was first approved for the treatment of adult patients with myelofibrosis by the FDA in 2011, followed by EMA's approval in 2012.[A229708] In 2014, it was approved for the treatment of polycythemia vera in adults who have an inadequate response to or are intolerant of [hydroxyurea] and in 2019, ruxolitinib was approved for use in steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease in adults and children.[L31958] The topical formulation of ruxolitinib is used to treat atopic dermatitis and vitiligo.[L39125] It is being investigated for other inflammatory skin conditions.[A229883]\r\n\r\nRuxolitinib has been investigated to treat patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) accompanied by severe systemic hyperinflammation. In phase II clinical trials, ruxolitinib improved chest computed tomography and improved recovery in patients with lymphopenia.[A229713, A229718] However, phase III clinical trials later determined that ruxolitinib was inadequate in meeting its primary endpoint of reducing the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who experienced severe complications [L31968] thus the drug was not approved as a treatment for COVID-19.",

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: The Janus kinase (JAK) family of protein tyrosine kinases comprises JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and non-receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2).[A229703] JAKs play a pivotal role in intracellular signalling pathways of various cytokines and growth factors essential to hematopoiesis, such as interleukin, erythropoietin, and thrombopoietin.[A7450] JAKs have diverse functions: JAK1 and JAK3 promote lymphocyte differentiation, survival, and function, while JAK2 promotes signal transduction of erythropoietin and thrombopoietin.[A229703, A229753] JAKs are in close proximity to the cytokine and growth factor receptor\u2019s cytoplasmic region. Upon binding of cytokines and growth factors, JAKs are activated, undergoing cross-phosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation. This process also reveals selective binding sites for STATs, which are DNA-binding proteins that also bind to the cytoplasmic region of cytokine or growth factor receptors. Activated JAKs and STATs translocate to the nucleus as transcription factors to regulate gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-10, and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB).[A229938] They also activate downstream pathways that promote erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic development.[A229703] \r\n\r\nThe molecular pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms is not fully understood; however, JAK2 is constitutively activated and the JAK-STAT signalling pathway becomes deregulated and aberrant.[A7450, A229938] Ruxolitinib is a selective and potent inhibitor of JAK2 and JAK1, with some affinity against JAK3 and TYK2. Anticancer effects of ruxolitinib are attributed to its inhibition of JAKs and JAK-mediated phosphorylation of STAT3.[L31938] By downregulating the JAK-STAT pathway, ruxolitinib inhibits myeloproliferation and suppresses the plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1.[A229703] \r\n\r\nActivated JAKs are also implicated in graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), which is a severe immune complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation GVHD is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, especially for patients who do not respond well to corticosteroid therapy. Activated JAKS stimulate T-effector cell responses, leading to increased proliferation of effector T cells and heightened production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. By blocking JAK1 and JAk2, ruxolitinib inhibits donor T-cell expansion and suppresses pro-inflammatory responses.[A229913]",
            "pharmacodynamics": "Pharmacodynamics: Ruxolitinib is an antineoplastic agent that inhibits cell proliferation, induces apoptosis of malignant cells, and reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine plasma levels by inhibiting JAK-induced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT).[A229703] Inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation, which is used as a marker of JAK activity, [A7450] by ruxolitinib is achieved at two hours after dosing which returned to near baseline by 10 hours in patients with myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera.[L31938] In clinical trials, ruxolitinib reduced splenomegaly and improved symptoms of myelofibrosis.[A229703] In a mouse model of myeloproliferative neoplasms, administration of ruxolitinib was associated with prolonged survival.[A7450] Ruxolitinib inhibits both mutant and wild-type JAK2 [A229703]; however, JAK2V617F mutation, which is often seen in approximately 50% of patients with myelofibrosis, was shown to reduce ruxolitinib sensitivity, which may also be associated with possible resistance to JAK inhibitor treatment.[A229933]",

Activation of GC-C results in an increase in both intracellular and extracellular concentrations of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Elevated intracellular cGMP activates the cGMP-dependent protein kinase II (PKG-II), which phosphorylates and activates the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ion channel expressed on the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells.[A260276] CFTR activation promotes the secretion of chloride and bicarbonate ions and inhibits sodium absorption, resulting in increased intestinal fluid and accelerated GI transit.[A260271, A260276, L47211]\r\n\r\nSecondly, linaclotide exerts anti-nociceptive effects by reducing visceral hypersensitivity.

Formestane, an aromatase inhibitor, can thus help to decrease the local production of estrogen by blocking the aromatase enzyme in peripheral tissues (ie. adispose tissue of the breast) to treat hormone sensitive breast cancer.

[3]\r\n\r\nIn comparative trials comparing a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor, anastrozole, with formestane, it was found that anastrozole was more effective and consistent at suppressing estrogen levels in the body.

Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) involved in inflammation. Specific effects of fluticasone furoate demonstrated in in vitro and in vivo models included activation of the glucocorticoid response element, inhibition of pro-inflammatory transcription factors such as NFkB, and inhibition of antigen-induced lung eosinophilia in sensitized rats.[A177130,L40838] These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy.[L40838]",

Gilotrif (afatinib) is the first FDA-approved oncology product from Boehringer Ingelheim [L2939].",

            "moa": "Mechanism of Action: Afatinib is a potent and selective, irreversible ErbB family blocker [L2937]. Afatinib covalently binds to and irreversibly blocks signaling from all homo and heterodimers formed by the ErbB family members EGFR (ErbB1), HER2 (ErbB2), ErbB3 and ErbB4 [L2937].\r\n\r\nIn particular, afatinib covalently binds to the kinase domains of EGFR (ErbB1), HER2 (ErbB2), and HER4 (ErbB4) and irreversibly inhibits tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation, resulting in downregulation of ErbB signaling [FDA Label]. Certain mutations in EGFR, including non-resistant mutations in its kinase domain, can result in increased autophosphorylation of the receptor, leading to receptor activation, sometimes in the absence of ligand binding, and can support cell proliferation in NSCLC [FDA Label]. Non-resistant mutations are defined as those occurring in exons constituting the kinase domain of EGFR that lead to increased receptor activation and where efficacy is predicted by 1) clinically meaningful tumor shrinkage with the recommended dose of afatinib and/or 2) inhibition of cellular proliferation or EGFR tyrosine kinase phosphorylation at concentrations of afatinib sustainable at the recommended dosage according to validated methods [FDA Label]. The most commonly found of these mutations are exon 21 L858R substitutions and exon 19 deletions [FDA Label].\r\n\r\nMoreover, afatinib demonstrated inhibition of autophosphorylation and/or in vitro proliferation of cell lines expressing wild-type EGFR and in those expressing selected EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations, exon 21 L858R mutations, or other less common non-resistant mutations, at afatinib concentrations achieved in patients [FDA Label]. In addition, afatinib inhibited in vitro proliferation of cell lines overexpressing HER2 [FDA Label].",

Mutation in EGFR defines a distinct molecular subtype of lung cancer [L2937].\r\n\r\nIn non-clinical disease models with ErbB pathway deregulation, afatinib as a single agent effectively blocks ErbB receptor signaling resulting in tumor growth inhibition or tumor regression [L2937]. NSCLC tumors with common activating EGFR mutations (Del 19, L858R) and several less common EGFR mutations in exon 18 (G719X) and exon 21 (L861Q) are particularly sensitive to afatinib treatment in non-clinical and clinical settings [L2937]. Limited non-clinical and/or clinical activity was observed in NSCLC tumors with insertion mutations in exon 20 [L2937].\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of a secondary T790M mutation is a major mechanism of acquired resistance to afatinib and gene dosage of the T790M-containing allele correlates with the degree of resistance in vitro [L2937]. The T790M mutation is found in approximately 50% of patients' tumors upon disease progression on afatinib, for which T790M targeted EGFR TKIs may be considered as a next line treatment option [L2937]. Other potential mechanisms of resistance to afatinib have been suggested preclinically and MET gene amplification has been observed clinically [L2937].\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the effect of multiple doses of afatinib (50 mg once daily) on cardiac electrophysiology and the QTc interval was evaluated in an open-label, single-arm study in patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors [FDA Label]. Ultimately, no large changes in the mean QTc interval (i.e., >20 ms) were detected in the study [FDA Label].",

Endothelins are released in both a constitutive fashion from secretory vesicles and in response to stimuli via Weibel-Palade storage granules.[A177277] Endothelins bind to the E<sub>A</sub> and E<sub>B</sub> receptors, with endothelins -1 and -2 having more affinity than endothelin-3.[A242402] Binding to the Gq coupled E<sub>A</sub> receptor triggers Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of smooth muscle cells via the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway. Downstream protein kinase C activation may also contribute to increased Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus. E<sub>A</sub> receptor activation is also known to contribute to pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation. The binding of endothelins to the E<sub>B</sub> receptors acts in opposition to E<sub>A</sub> signaling by activating the same PLC cascade in endothelial cells to activate endothelial nitric oxide synthase. The subsequent release of nitric oxide produces vasodilation through the cyclic guanosine monophosphate cascade.[A177277] Despite the greater presence of E<sub>B</sub> receptors on endothelial cells, they are still present on smooth muscle cells and may contribute to cell proliferation through the same mechanisms as E<sub>A</sub> receptors.[A242402] Macitentan is thought to provide its therapeutic effect primarily via blocking signaling through E<sub>A</sub> which produces both decreased vasoconstriction via reduced smooth muscle cell contractility and attenuation of the hyperproliferation of smooth muscle cells found in PAH. Blockade of E<sub>B</sub> is less likely to contribute to a therapeutic effect as this signaling is responsible for the counter-regulatory vasodilatory signal.",

            "summary": "Sofosbuvir (tradename Sovaldi) is a direct acting antiviral medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as sofosbuvir. As a prodrug nucleotide analog, Sofosbuvir is metabolized into its active form as the antiviral agent 2'-deoxy-2'-\u03b1-fluoro-\u03b2-C-methyluridine-5'-triphosphate (also known as GS-461203), which acts as a defective substrate for NS5B (non-structural protein 5B) [synthesis]. NS5B, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is essential for the transcription of Hepatitis C viral RNA and for its high replicative rate and genetic diversity [A19594]. Sofosbuvir and other direct acting antivirals are therefore very potent options for the treatment of Hepatitis C, as they exhibit a high barrier to the development of resistance [A19593]. This is an important advantage relative to HCV drugs that target other viral enzymes such as the protease, for which rapid development of resistance has proven to be an important cause of therapeutic failure.  \r\n\r\nIn a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Sofosbuvir as first line therapy in combination with other antivirals for all six genotypes of Hepatitis C [L852]. Depending on the genotype, sofosbuvir is often used in combination with other antivirals such as [DB09027], [DB11613], [DB09102], [DB06290], [DB11574], [DB11575], [DB00811], [DB00008], or [DB00022] with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. Treatment with direct acting antivirals such as sofosbuvir is associated with very minimal side effects, with the most common being headache and fatigue [FDA Label]. Lack of significant side effects and short duration of therapy is a considerable advantage over older interferon- and ribavirin-based regimens, which were limited by infusion site reactions, reduced blood count, and neuropsychiatric effects [A19635]. \r\n\r\nSince 2014, sofosbuvir has been available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB09027] (tradename Harvoni) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in October 2014 by the FDA, Harvoni is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6 with or without [DB00811] depending on the level of liver damage or cirrhosis [FDA Label].  When combined together, ledipasvir and sofosbuvir as the combination product Harvoni has been shown to achieve a SVR between 93 and 99% after 12 weeks of treatment [A7535]. Its use has also proven successful in the treatment of HCV in patients co-infected with HIV [A19627].\r\n\r\nSofosbuvir is also available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB11613] as the commercially available product Epclusa. First approved in June 2016, Epclusa is the first combination HCV product indicated for the treatment of all genotypes of Hepatitis C with or without cirrhosis. Epclusa is also currently the most potent HCV antiviral medication on the market with a sustained virologic response (SVR) after 12 weeks of therapy of 93-99% depending on genotype and level of cirrhosis [L852]. Both Canadian and American guidelines list Epclusa as a first line recommendation for all genotypes of HCV [L852, A19626].\r\n\r\nNotably, sofosbuvir has come under intense scrutiny since its release to market in 2013.

            "summary": "N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDARs) are members of the ionotropic glutamate receptor family, with key roles in brain development and neurological function.[A220118, A220128] NMDARs are heterotetramers that typically involve a dimer of dimers of both GluN1 and GluN2A-D subunits, with each subunit itself composed of an N-terminal domain (NTD), a ligand-binding domain (LBD), a transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Binding at the LBD of the agonists glycine (or D-serine) to the GluN1 subunits and of glutamate to the GluN2 subunits is a regulatory mechanism for channel activation. In addition, allosteric modulators are known to bind at the NTDs and form another layer of regulation.[A220118, A220128] One such allosteric regulator is ifenprodil, which was first shown to bind the NMDARs in the 1990s, and specifically to those NMDARs containing the GluN2B subunit.[A220133] Further studies elucidated that ifenprodil binds strongly at the inter-subunit interface of adjacent GluN1 and GluN2B NTDs, where it acts as a non-competitive antagonist.[A220118, A220128]\r\n\r\nAlthough ifenprodil has received considerable interest in its potential neuromodulatory activities in psychiatric conditions, including dependency[A220138] and depression,[A220143] it has also been shown to have an immunomodulatory effect.[A220143, A196128] In an unbiased screen for compounds capable of reducing cell death induced by infection with the influenza strain H5N1, ifenprodil was found to have a protective effect against H5N1-induced lung damage, in part through its ability to alleviate the H5N1-induced cytokine storm and reduce pulmonary infiltration of neutrophils, natural killer cells, and T cells.[A196128] Ifenprodil is being investigated for its potential utility in treating COVID-19 in an ongoing phase 2b/3 clinical trial (NCT04382924).[L16343]",
